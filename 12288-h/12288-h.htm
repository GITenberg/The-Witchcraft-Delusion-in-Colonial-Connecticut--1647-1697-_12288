<br />
The true story of witchcraft in old Connecticut has never been told. It has been hidden in the ancient records and in manuscripts in private collections, and those most conversant with the facts have not made them known, for one reason or another. It is herein written from authoritative sources, and should prove of interest and value as a present-day interpretation of that strange delusion, which for a half century darkened the lives of the forefathers and foremothers of the colonial days.

&quot;First, because Witchcraft is a rife and common sinne in these our daies, and very many are intangled with it, beeing either practitioners thereof in their owne persons, or at the least, yielding to seeke for helpe and counsell of such as practise it.&quot; <i>A Discovrse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft</i>, PERKINS, 1610.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">
&quot;And just as God has his human servants, his church on earth, so also the Devil has his&mdash;men and women sworn to his service and true to his bidding. To win such followers he can appear to men in any form he pleases, can deceive them, enter into compact with them, initiate them into his worship, make them his allies for the ruin of their fellows. Now it is these human allies and servants of Satan, thus postulated into existence by the brain of a monkish logician, whom history knows as witches.&quot; <i>The Literature   of Witchcraft</i>, BURR.</font></p>
<br />

<p>Witchcraft in its generic sense is as old as human history. It has written its name in the oldest of human records. In all ages and among all peoples it has taken firm hold on the fears, convictions and consciences of men. Anchored in credulity and superstition, in the dread and love of mystery, in the hard and fast theologic doctrines and teachings of diabolism, and under the ban of the law from its beginning, it has borne a baleful fruitage in the lives of the learned and the unlearned, the wise and the simple.</p>

<p>King and prophet, prelate and priest, jurist and lawmaker, prince and peasant, scholars and men of affairs <a name="pg002"></a>have felt and dreaded its subtle power, and sought relief in code and commandment, bull and anathema, decree and statute&mdash;entailing even the penalty of death&mdash;and all in vain until in the march of the races to a higher civilization, the centuries enthroned faith in the place of fear, wisdom in the place of ignorance, and sanity in the seat of delusion.</p>

<p>In its earlier historic conception witchcraft and its demonstrations centered in the claim of power to produce certain effects, &quot;things beyond the course of nature,&quot; from supernatural causes, and under this general term all its occult manifestations were classified with magic and sorcery, until the time came when the Devil was identified and acknowledged both in church and state as the originator and sponsor of the mystery, sin and crime&mdash;the sole father of the Satanic compacts with
men and women, and the law both canonical and civil took cognizance of his malevolent activities.</p>

<p>In the Acropolis mound at Susa in ancient Elam, in the winter of 1901-2, there was brought to light by the French expedition in charge of the eminent savant, M. de Morgan, one of the most remarkable memorials of early civilization ever recovered from the buried cities of the Orient.</p>

<p>It is a monolith&mdash;a stele of black diorite&mdash;bearing in bas-relief a likeness of Hammurabi (the Amrephel of the Old Testament; Genesis xiv, 1), and the sixth king of the first Babylonian dynasty, who reigned about 2250 B.C.; and there is also carved upon it, in archaic script in black letter cuneiform&mdash;used long after the cursive writing was invented&mdash;the longest Babylonian record discovered to <a name="pg003"></a>this day,&mdash;the oldest body of laws in existence and the basis of historical
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable code, quickly made available through translation and transliteration by the Assyrian scholars, and justly named, from its royal compiler, Hammurabi's code. He was an imperialist in purpose and action, and in the last of his reign of fifty-five years he annexed or assimilated the suzerainty of Elam, or Southern Persia, with Assyria to the north, and also Syria and Palestine, to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>This record in stone originally contained nineteen columns of
inscriptions of four thousand three hundred and fourteen lines, arranged in two hundred and eighty sections, covering about two hundred separate decisions or edicts. There is substantial evidence that many of the laws were of greater antiquity than the code itself, which is a thousand years older than the Mosaic code, and there are many striking resemblances and parallels between its provisions, and the law of the covenant, and the deuteronomy laws of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>The code was based on personal responsibility. It protects the sanctity of an oath before God, provides among many other things for written evidence in legal matters, and is wonderfully comprehensive and rich in rules for the conduct of commercial, civic, financial, social, economic, and domestic affairs.</p>

<p>These sections are notably illustrative:</p>

<p>&quot;If a man, in a case (pending judgment), utters threats against the witnesses (or), does not establish the testimony that he has given, if that case be a case involving life, that man shall be put to death.</p>
<a name="pg004"></a>
<p>&quot;If a judge pronounces a judgment, renders a decision, delivers a verdict duly signed and sealed and afterwards alters his judgment, they shall call that judge to account for the alteration of the judgment which he had pronounced, and he shall pay twelvefold the penalty which was in the said judgment, and, in the assembly, they shall expel him from his seat of judgment, and he shall not return, and with the judges in a case he shall not take his seat.</p>

<p>&quot;If a man practices brigandage and is captured, that man shall be put to death.</p>

<p>&quot;If a woman hates her husband, and says: 'thou shalt not have me,' they shall inquire into her antecedents for her defects; and if she has been a careful mistress and is without reproach and her husband has been going about and greatly belittling her, that woman has no blame. She shall receive her presents and shall go to her father's house.</p>

<p>&quot;If she has not been a careful mistress, has gadded about, has neglected her house and has belittled her husband, they shall throw that woman into the water.</p>

<p>&quot;If a physician operates on a man for a severe wound with a bronze lancet and causes the man's death, or opens an abscess (in the eye) of a man with a bronze lancet and destroys the man's eye, they shall cut off his fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;If a builder builds a house for a man and does not make its
construction firm and the house, which he has built, collapses and
causes the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death.&quot;</p>

<p>It is, however, with only one of King Hammurabi's wise laws that this inquiry has to do, and it is this:</p>
<a name="pg005"></a>
<p>&quot;If a man has placed an enchantment upon a man, and has not justified himself, he upon whom the enchantment is placed to the Holy River (Euphrates) shall go; into the Holy River he shall plunge. If the Holy River holds (drowns) him he who enchanted him shall take his house. If on the contrary, the man is safe and thus is innocent, the wizard loses his life, and his house.&quot;</p>

<p>Or, as another translation has it:</p>

<p>&quot;If a man ban a man and cast a spell on him&mdash;if he cannot justify it he
who has banned shall be killed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If a man has cast a spell on a man and has not justified it, he on whom
the spell has been thrown shall go to the River God, and plunge into the
river. If the River God takes him he who has banned him shall be saved.
If the River God show him to be innocent, and he be saved, he who banned
him shall be killed, and he who plunged into the river shall take the
house of him who banned him.&quot;</p>

<p>There can be no more convincing evidence of the presence and power of
the great witchcraft superstition among the primitive races than this
earliest law; and it is to be especially noted that it prescribes one of
the very tests of guilt&mdash;the proof by water&mdash;which was used in another
form centuries later, on the continent, in England and New England, at
Wurzburg and Bonn, at Rouen, in Suffolk, Essex and Devon, and at Salem
and Hartford and Fairfield, when &quot;the Devil starteth himself up in the
pulpit, like a meikle black man, and calling the row (roll) everyone
answered, Here!&quot;</p>

<a name="chap2"></a><h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;To deny the possibility, nay actual evidence of witchcraft
  and sorcery, is at once to flatly contradict the revealed word of God in various
  passages both of the Old and New Testaments.&quot; <i>Blackstone's Commentaries</i>
  (Vol. 4, ch. 4, p. 60).</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;It was simply the natural result of Puritanical teaching
  acting on the mind, predisposing men to see Satanic influence in life, and consequently
  eliciting the phenomena of witchcraft.&quot; LECKY's <i>Rationalism in Europe</i>
  (Vol. I, p. 123).</font></p>
<br />

<p>Witchcraft's reign in many lands and among many peoples is also attested
in its remarkable nomenclature. Consider its range in ancient, medieval
and modern thought as shown in some of its definitions: Magic, sorcery,
soothsaying, necromancy, astrology, wizardry, mysticism, occultism, and
conjuring, of the early and middle ages; compacts with Satan, consorting
with evil spirits, and familiarity with the Devil, of later times; all
at last ripening into an epidemic demonopathy with its countless victims
of fanaticism and error, malevolence and terror, of persecution and
ruthless sacrifices.</p>

<p>It is still most potent in its evil, grotesque, and barbaric forms, in
Fetichism, Voodooism, Bundooism, Obeahism, and Kahunaism, in the devil
and animal ghost worship of the black races, completely exemplified in
the arts of the Fetich wizard on the Congo; in the &quot;Uchawi&quot; of the
Wasequhha mentioned by Stanley; in the marriage customs of the Soudan
devil worshipers; in the practices of <a name="pg007"></a>the Obeah men and women in the
Caribbees&mdash;notably their power in matters of love and business, religion
and war&mdash;in Jamaica; in the incantations of the kahuna in Hawaii; and in
the devices of the voodoo or conjure doctor in the southern states; in
the fiendish rites and ceremonies of the red men,&mdash;the Hoch-e-ayum of
the Plains Indians, the medicine dances of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes,
the fire dance of the Navajos, the snake dance of the Moquis, the sun
dance of the Sioux, in the myths and tales of the Cherokees; and it
rings in many tribal chants and songs of the East and West.</p>

<p>It lives as well, and thrives luxuriantly, ripe for the full vintage, in
the minds of many people to whom this or that trivial incident or
accident of life is an omen of good or evil fortune with a mysterious
parentage. Its roots strike deep in that strange element in human nature
which dreads whatsoever is weird and uncanny in common experiences, and
sees strange portents and dire chimeras in all that is unexplainable to
the senses. It is made most virile in the desire for knowledge of the
invisible and intangible, that must ever elude the keenest inquiry, a
phase of thought always to be reckoned with when imagination runs riot,
and potent in its effect, though evanescent as a vision the brain
sometimes retains of a dream, and as senseless in the cold light of
reason as Monna Sidonia's invocation at the Witches' Sabbath: (<i>Romance

<p>Above all, in its literature does witchcraft exhibit the conclusive
proof of its age, its hydra-headed forms, and its influence in the
intellectual and spiritual development of the races of men.</p>

<p>What of this literature? Count in it all the works that treat of the
subject in its many phases, and its correlatives, and it is limitless, a
literature of all times and all lands.</p>

<p>Christian and pagan gave it place in their religions, <a name="pg009"></a>dogmas, and
articles of faith and discipline, and in their codes of law; and for
four hundred years, from the appeal of Pope John XXII, in 1320, to
extirpate the Devil-worshipers, to the repeal of the statute of James I
in 1715, the delusion gave point and force to treatises, sermons,
romances, and folk-lore, and invited, nay, compelled, recognition at the
hands of the scientist and legist, the historian, the poet and the
dramatist, the theologian and philosopher.</p>

<p>But the monographic literature of witchcraft, as it is here considered,
is limited, in the opinion of a scholar versed in its lore, to fifteen
hundred titles. There is a mass of unpublished materials in libraries
and archives at home and abroad, and of information as to witchcraft and
the witch trials, accessible in court records, depositions, and current
accounts in public and private collections, all awaiting the coming of
some master hand to transform them into an exhaustive history of the
most grievous of human superstitions.</p>

<p>To this day, there has been no thorough investigation or complete
analysis of the history of the witch persecutions. The true story has
been distorted by partisanship and ignorance, and left to exploitation
by the romancer, the empiric, and the sciolist.</p>

<p>&quot;Of the origin and nature of the delusion we know perhaps enough; but of
the causes and paths of its spread, of the extent of its ravages, of its
exact bearing upon the intellectual and religious freedom of its times,
of the soul-stirring details of the costly struggle by which it was
overborne we are lamentably ill informed.&quot; (<i>The Literature of
Witchcraft</i>, p. 66, BURR.)</p>

<p><a name="pg010"></a>It must serve in this brief narrative to merely note, within the
centuries which marked the climax of the mania, some of the most
authoritative and influential works in giving strength to its evil
purpose and the modes of accusation, trial, and punishment.</p>

<p>Modern scholarship holds that witchcraft, with the Devil as the arch
enemy of mankind for its cornerstone, was first exploited by the
Dominicans of the Inquisition. They blazed the tortuous way for the
scholastic theology which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
gave new recognition to Satan and his satellites as the sworn enemies of
God and his church, and the Holy Inquisition with its massive enginery,
open and secret, turned its attention to the exposure and extirpation of
the heretics and sinners who were enlisted in the Devil's service.</p>

<p>Take for adequate illustration these standard authorities in the early
periods of the widespread and virulent epidemic:</p>

<p>Those of the Inquisitor General, Eymeric, in 1359, entitled <i>Tractatus
contra d&aelig;monum</i>; the Formicarius or Ant Hill of the German Dominican
Nider, 1337; the <i>De calcatione d&aelig;monum</i>, 1452; the <i>Flagellum
h&aelig;reticorum fascinariorum</i> of the French Inquisitor Jaquier in 1458; and
the <i>Fortalitium fidei</i> of the Spanish Franciscan Alonso de Spina, in
1459; the famous and infamous manual of arguments and rules of procedure
for the detection and punishment of witches, compiled by the German
Inquisitors Kr&auml;mer and Sprenger (Institor) in 1489, buttressed on the
bull of Pope Innocent VIII; (this was the celebrated <i>Witch Hammer</i>,
bearing on its title page the significant <a name="pg011"></a>legend, &quot;<i>Not to believe in
witchcraft is the greatest of heresies</i>&quot;); the Canon Episcopi; the bulls
of Popes John XXII, 1330, Innocent VIII, 1484, Alexander VI, 1494, Leo
X, 1521, and Adrian VI, 1522; the Decretals of the canon law; the
exorcisms of the Roman and Greek churches, all hinged on scriptural
precedents; the Roman law, the Twelve Tables, and the Justinian Code,
the last three imposing upon the crimes of conjuring, exorcising,
magical arts, offering sacrifices to the injury of one's neighbors,
sorcery, and witchcraft, the penalties of death by torture, fire, or
crucifixion.</p>

<p>Add to these classics some of the later authorities: the <i>D&aelig;monologie</i>
of the royal inquisitor James I of England and Scotland, 1597; Mores'
<i>Antidote to Atheism</i>; Fuller's <i>Holy and Profane State</i>; Granvil's
<i>Sadducismus Triumphatus</i>, 1681; <i>Tryal of Witches at the Assizes for
the County of Suffolk before Sir Matthew Hale, March, 1664</i> (London,
1682); Baxter's <i>Certainty of the World of Spirits</i>, 1691; Cotton
Mather's <i>A Discourse on Witchcraft</i>, 1689, his <i>Late Memorable
Providences Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions</i>, 1684, and his
<i>Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, 1692; and enough references have been
made to this literature of delusion, to the precedents that seared the
consciences of courts and juries in their sentences of men, women, and
children to death by the rack, the wheel, the stake, and the gallows.</p>

<p>Where in history are the horrors of the curse more graphically told than
in the words of Canon Linden, an eye witness of the demonic deeds at
Trier (Treves) in 1589?</p>

<p>&quot;And so, from court to court throughout the towns and <a name="pg012"></a>villages of all
the diocese, scurried special accusers, inquisitors, notaries, jurors,
judges, constables, dragging to trial and torture human beings of both
sexes and burning them in great numbers. Scarcely any of those who were
accused escaped punishment. Nor were there spared even the leading men
in the city of Trier. For the Judge, with two Burgomasters, several
Councilors and Associate Judges, canons of sundry collegiate churches,
parish-priests, rural deans, were swept away in this ruin. So far, at
length, did the madness of the furious populace and of the courts go in
this thirst for blood and booty that there was scarcely anybody who was
not smirched by some suspicion of this crime.</p>

<p>&quot;Meanwhile notaries, copyists, and innkeepers grew rich. The executioner
rode a blooded horse, like a noble of the court, and went clad in gold
and silver; his wife vied with noble dames in the richness of her array.
The children of those convicted and punished were sent into exile; their
goods were confiscated; plowman and vintner failed.&quot; (<i>The Witch
Persecutions</i>, pp. 13-14, BURR.)</p>

<p>Fanaticism did not rule and ruin without hindrance and remonstrance. Men
of great learning and exalted position struck mighty blows at the root
of the evil. They could not turn the tide but they stemmed it, and their
attacks upon the whole theory of Satanic power and the methods of
persecution were potent in the reaction to humanity and a reign of
reason.</p>

<p>Always to be remembered among these men of power are Johann Wier,
Friedrich Spee, and notably Reginald Scot, who in his <i>Discovery of
Witchcraft</i>, in 1584, undertook to prove that &quot;the contracts and
compacts of witches <a name="pg013"></a>with devils and all infernal spirits and familiars,
are but erroneous novelties and erroneous conceptions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all it is setting a high value on our conjectures to roast a man
alive on account of them.&quot; (MONTAIGNE.)</p>

<p>Who may measure in romance and the drama the presence, the cogent and
undeniable power of those same abiding elements of mysticism and
mystery, which underlie all human experience, and repeated in myriad
forms find their classic expression in the queries of the &quot;Weird
Sisters,&quot; &quot;<i>those elemental avengers without sex or kin</i>&quot;?</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;When shall we three meet again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thunder, lightning or in rain?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the hurly burly's done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the battle's lost and won.&quot;</span><br />

<p>Are not the mummeries of the witches about the cauldron in Macbeth, and
Talbot's threat pour la Pucelle,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,&quot;</span></p>

<p>uttered so long ago, echoed in the wailing cry of La Meffraye in the
forests of Machecoul, in the maledictions of Grio, and of the Saga of
the Burning Fields?</p>

<p>Their vitality is also clearly shown in their constant use and
exemplification by the romance and novel writers who appeal with
certainty and success to the popular taste in the tales of spectral
terrors. Witness: Farjeon's <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>; Bierce's <i>The
Damned Thing</i>; Bulwer's <i>A Strange Story</i>; Cranford's <i>Witch of Prague</i>;
Howells' <i>The Shadow of a Dream</i>; Winthrop's <i>Cecil Dreeme</i>; Grusot's
<i>Night Side of Nature</i>; Crockett's <a name="pg014"></a>Black Douglas; and <i>The Red Axe</i>,
Francis' <i>Lychgate Hall</i>; Caine's <i>The Shadow of a Crime</i>; and countless
other stories, traditions, tales, and legends, written and unwritten,
that invite and receive a gracious hospitality on every hand.</p>

<a name="chap3"></a><h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;A belief in witchcraft had always existed; it was entertained
  by Coke, Bacon, Hale and even Blackstone. It was a misdemeanor at English common
  law and made a felony without benefit of clergy by 33 Henry VIII, c. 8, and
  5 Eliz., c. 16, and the more severe statute of I Jas. 1, ch. 12.&quot; <i>Connecticut&mdash;Origin
  of her Courts and Laws</i> (N.E. States, Vol I, p. 487-488), HAMERSLEY.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;Selden took up a somewhat peculiar and characteristic
  position. He maintained that the law condemning women to death for witchcraft
  was perfectly just, but that it was quite unnecessary to ascertain whether witchcraft
  was a possibility. A woman might not be able to destroy the life of her neighbor
  by her incantations; but if she intended to do so, it was right that she should
  be hung.&quot; <i>Rationalism in Europe</i> (Vol. 1, p. 123) LECKY.</font></p>
<br />

<p>The fundamental authority for legislation, for the decrees of courts and
councils as to witchcraft, from the days of the Witch of Endor to those
of Mercy Disborough of Fairfield, and Giles Corey of Salem Farms, was
the code of the Hebrews and its recognition in the Gospel dispensations.
Thereon rest most of the historic precedents, legislative,
ecclesiastical, and judicial.</p>

<p>&quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; Exodus xxii, 18.</p>

<p>What law embalmed in ancientry and honored as of divine origin has been
more fruitful of sacrifice and suffering? Through the Scriptures,
gathering potency as it goes, runs the same grim decree, with widening
definitions.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="pg016"></a>And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits and
after wizards ... I will even set my face against that soul and will cut
him off from among his people.&quot; Deuteronomy xviii, 10-11.</p>

<p>&quot;There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his
daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an
observer of times, or an enchanter, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.&quot; Deuteronomy xviii, 10-11.</p>

<p>&quot;Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards out
of the land.&quot; Samuel i, 3.</p>

<p>&quot;Now Saul the king of the Hebrews, had cast out of the country the
fortune tellers, and the necromancers, and all such as exercised the
like arts, excepting the prophets.... Yet did he bid his servants to
inquire out for him some woman that was a necromancer, and called up the
souls of the dead, that so he might know whether his affairs would
succeed to his mind; for this sort of necromantic women that bring up
the souls of the dead, do by them foretell future events.&quot; Josephus,
Book 6, ch. 14.</p>

<p>&quot;For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.&quot; Samuel i, 15-23.</p>

<p>&quot;And I will cut off witchcraft out of the land.&quot; Micah v. 12.</p>

<p>&quot;Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together
and burned them.&quot; Acts xix, 19.</p>

<p>&quot;But there was a certain man called Simon which beforetime in the same
city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria.&quot; Acts viii, 9.</p>
<a name="pg017"></a>
<p>&quot;If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
withered, and men gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are
burned.&quot;<a name="fnanchorC3"></a><a href="#footnoteC3">[C]</a> John xv, 6.</p>

<p><a name="footnoteC3"></a><a href="#fnanchorC3">[C]</a> In the opinion of the eminent Italian jurist Bartolo,
witches were burned alive in early times on this authority.</p>

<p>These citations make clear the scriptural recognition of witchcraft as a
heinous sin and crime. It is, however, necessary to draw a broad line of
demarcation between the ancient forms and manifestations which have been
brought into view for an illustrative purpose, and that delusion or
mania which centered in the theologic belief and teaching that Satan was
the arch enemy of mankind, and clothed with such power over the souls of
men as to make compacts with them, and to hold supremacy over them in
the warfare between good and evil.</p>

<p>The church from its earliest history looked upon witchcraft as a deadly
sin, and disbelief in it as a heresy, and set its machinery in motion
for its extirpation. Its authority was the word of God and the civil
law, and it claimed jurisdiction through the ecclesiastical courts, the
secular courts, however, acting as the executive of their decrees and
sentences.</p>

<p>Such was the cardinal principle which governed in the merciless attempts
to suppress the epidemic in spreading from the continent to England and
Scotland, and at last to the Puritan colonies in America, where the last
chapter of its history was written.</p>

<p>There can be no better, no more comprehensive modern definition of the
crime once a heresy, or of the popular conception of it, than the one
set forth in the New England indictments, to wit: &quot;interteining
familiarity with Satan the <a name="pg018"></a>enemy of mankind, and by his help doing
works above the course of nature.&quot;</p>

<p>In few words Henry Charles Lea, in his <i>History of the Inquisition in
the Middle Ages</i>, analyzes the development of the Satanic doctrine from
a superstition into its acceptance as a dogma of Christian belief.</p>

<p>&quot;As Satan's principal object in his warfare with God was to seduce human
souls from their divine allegiance, he was ever ready with whatever
temptation seemed most likely to effect his purpose. Some were to be won
by physical indulgence; others by conferring on them powers enabling
them apparently to forecast the future, to discover hidden things, to
gratify enmity, and to acquire wealth, whether through forbidden arts or
by the services of a familiar demon subject to their orders. As the
neophyte in receiving baptism renounced the devil, his pomps and his
angels, it was necessary for the Christian who desired the aid of Satan
to renounce God. Moreover, as Satan when he tempted Christ offered him
the kingdoms of the earth in return for adoration&mdash;'If thou therefore
wilt worship me all shall be thine' (Luke iv, 7)&mdash;there naturally arose
the idea that to obtain this aid it was necessary to render allegiance
to the prince of hell. Thence came the idea, so fruitful in the
development of sorcery, of compacts with Satan by which sorcerers became
his slaves, binding themselves to do all the evil they could to follow
their example. Thus the sorcerer or witch was an enemy of all the human
race as well as of God, the most efficient agent of hell in its
sempiternal conflict with heaven. His destruction, by any method, was
therefore the plainest duty of man.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="pg019"></a>This was the perfected theory of sorcery and witchcraft by which the
gentle superstitions inherited and adopted from all sides were fitted
into the Christian dispensation and formed part of its accepted creed.&quot;
(<i>History of Inquisition in the Middle Ages</i>, 3, 385, LEA.)</p>

<p>Once the widespread superstition became adapted to the forms of
religious faith and discipline, and &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot;
was clothed with new energies, the Devil was taken broader account of by
Christianity itself; the sorcery of the ancients was embodied in the
Christian conception of witchcraft; and the church undertook to deal
with it as a heresy; the door was opened wide to the sweep of the
epidemic in some of the continental lands.</p>

<p>In Bamburg and Wurzburg, Geneva and Como, Toulouse and Lorraine, and in
many other places in Italy, Germany, and France, thousands were
sacrificed in the names of religion, justice, and law, with bigotry for
their advocate, ignorance for their judge, and fanaticism for their
executioner. The storm of demonism raged through three centuries, and
was stayed only by the mighty barriers of protest, of inquiry, of
remonstrance, and the forces that crystallize and mold public opinion,
which guides the destinies of men in their march to a higher
civilization.</p>

<p>The flames burning so long and so fiercely on the continent at first
spread slowly in England and Scotland. Sorcery in some of its guises had
obtained therein ever since the Conquest, and victims had been burned
under the king's writ after sentence in the ecclesiastical courts; but
witchcraft as a compact with Satan was not made a felony until 1541, by
a statute of Henry VIII. Cranmer, in his <i>Articles of Visitation</i> in
1549, enjoined the clergy <a name="pg020"></a>to inquire as to any craft invented by the
Devil; and Bishop Jewell, preaching before the queen in 1558, said:</p>

<p>&quot;It may please your Grace to understand that witches and sorcerers
within these last few years are marvelously increased within your
Grace's realm, Your Grace's subjects pine away even unto the death,
their colour fadeth, their flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed,
their senses are bereft.&quot;</p>

<p>The act of 1541 was amended in Queen Elizabeth's reign, in 1562, but at
the accession of James I&mdash;himself a fanatic and bigot in religious
matters, and the author of the famous <i>D&aelig;monologie</i>&mdash;a new law was
enacted with exact definition of the crime, which remained in force more
than a hundred years. Its chief provision was this:</p>

<p>&quot;If any person or persons use, practice or exercise any invocation or
conjuration of any evil and wicked spirit, or shall consult, covenant
with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil and wicked spirit to or
for any intent or purpose, or take up any dead man, woman, or child out
of his, her or their grave, or any other place where the dead body
resteth or the skin, bone, or any part of any dead person, to be
employed or used in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or
enchantment, or shall use, practise, or exercise any witchcraft,
enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby any person shall be killed,
destroyed, wasted, consumed, pined or lamed in his or her body or any
part thereof: every such offender is a felon without benefit of clergy.&quot;</p>

<p>Under this law, and the methods of its administration, witchcraft so
called increased; persecutions multiplied, especially under the
Commonwealth, and notably in the <a name="pg021"></a>eastern counties of England, whence so
many of all estates, all sorts and conditions of men, had fled over seas
to set up the standard of independence in the Puritan colonies.</p>

<p>Many executions occurred in Lancashire, in Suffolk, Essex, and
Huntingdonshire, where the infamous scoundrel &quot;Witch-finder-General&quot;
Matthew Hopkins, under the sanction of the courts, was &quot;pricking,&quot;
&quot;waking,&quot; &quot;watching,&quot; and &quot;testing&quot; persons suspected or accused of
witchcraft, with fiendish ingenuity of indignity and torture. Says James
Howell in his <i>Familiar Letters</i>, in 1646:</p>

<p>&quot;We have multitudes of witches among us; for in Essex and Suffolk there
were above two hundred indicted within these two years, and above the
half of them executed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Within the compass of two years (1645-7), near upon three hundred
witches were arraigned, and the major part of them executed in Essex and
Suffolk only. Scotland swarms with them more and more, and persons of
good quality are executed daily.&quot;</p>

<p>Scotland set its seal on witchcraft as a crime by an act of its
parliament so early as 1563, amended in 1649. The ministers were the
inquisitors and persecutors. They heard the confessions, and inflicted
the tortures, and their cruelties were commensurate with the hard and
fast theology that froze the blood of mercy in their veins.</p>

<p>The trials were often held by special commissions issued by the privy
council, on the petition of a presbytery or general assembly. It was
here that those terrible instruments of torture, the caschielawis, the
lang irnis, the boot and the pilliewinkis, were used to wring
confessions from the wretched victims. It is all a strange and gruesome
<a name="pg022"></a>story of horrors told in detail in the state trial records, and
elsewhere, from the execution of Janet Douglas&mdash;Lady Glammis&mdash;to that of
the poor old woman at Dornoch who warmed herself at the fire set for her
burning. So firmly seated in the Scotch mind was the belief in
witchcraft as a sin and crime, that when the laws against it were
repealed in 1736, Scotchmen in the highest stations of church and state
remonstrated against the repeal as contrary to the law of God; and
William Forbes, in his &quot;Institutes of the Law of Scotland,&quot; calls
witchcraft &quot;that black art whereby strange and wonderful things are
wrought by a power derived from the devil.&quot;</p>

<p>This glance at what transpired on the continent and in England and
Scotland is of value, in the light it throws on the beliefs and
convictions of both Pilgrim and Puritan&mdash;Englishmen all&mdash;in their new
domain, their implicit reliance on established precedents, their
credulity in witchcraft matters, and their absolute trust in scriptural
and secular authority for their judicial procedure, and the execution of
the grim sentences of the courts, until the revolting work of the
accuser and the searcher, and the delusion of the ministers and
magistrates aflame with mistaken zeal vanished in the sober
afterthought, the reaction of the public mind and conscience, which at
last crushed the machinations of the Devil and his votaries in high
places.</p>

<a name="chap4"></a><h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;Hence among all the superstitions that have 'stood over'
  from primeval ages, the belief in witchcraft has been the most deeply rooted
  and the most tenacious of life. In all times and places until quite lately,
  among the most advanced communities, the reality of witchcraft has been accepted
  without question, and scarcely any human belief is supported by so vast a quantity
  of recorded testimony.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;Considering the fact that the exodus of Puritans to New
  England occurred during the reign of Charles I, while the persecutions for witchcraft
  were increasing toward a maximum in the mother country, it is rather strange
  that so few cases occurred in the New World.&quot; <i>New France and New England</i>
  (pp. 136-144), FISKE.</font></p>
<br />

<p>The forefathers believed in witchcraft&mdash;entering into compacts with the
Devil&mdash;and in all its diabolical subtleties. They had cogent reasons for
their belief in example and experience. They set it down in their codes
as a capital offense. They found, as has been shown abundant authority
in the Bible and in the English precedents. They anchored their criminal
codes as they did their theology in the wide and deep haven of the Old
Testament decrees and prophecies and maledictions, and doubted not that
&quot;the Scriptures do hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and
government of all men in all duties which they are to perform to God and
men.&quot;</p>

<p>Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven, early in their history
enacted these capital laws:</p>

<p>In Massachusetts (1641):</p>
<a name="pg024"></a>
<p>&quot;Witchcraft which is fellowship by covenant with a familiar spirit to
be punished with death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Consulters with witches not to be tolerated, but either to be cut off
by death or banishment or other suitable punishment.&quot; (<i>Abstract New
England Laws</i>, 1655.)</p>

<p>In Connecticut (1642):</p>

<p>&quot;If any man or woman be a witch&mdash;that is, hath or consulteth with a
familiar spirit&mdash;they shall be put to death.&quot; Exodus xxii, 18; Leviticus
xx, 27; Deuteronomy xviii, 10, 11. (<i>Colonial Records of Connecticut</i>,
Vol. I, p. 77).</p>

<p>In New Haven (1655):</p>

<p>&quot;If any person be a witch, he or she shall be put to death according to&quot;
Exodus xxii, 18; Leviticus xx, 27; Deuteronomy xviii, 10, 11. (<i>New
Haven Colonial Records</i>, Vol. II, p. 576, Cod. 1655).</p>

<p>These laws were authoritative until the epidemic had ceased.</p>

<p>Witches were tried, condemned, and executed with no question as to due
legal power, in the minds of juries, counsel, and courts, until the hour
of reaction came, hastened by doubts and criticisms of the sources and
character of evidence, and the magistrates and clergy halted in their
prosecutions and denunciations of an alleged crime born of delusion, and
nurtured by a theology run rampant.</p>

<p>&quot;They had not been taught to question the wisdom or the humanity of
English criminal law.&quot; (<i>Blue Laws&mdash;True and False</i>, p. 15, TRUMBULL.)</p>

<p>Here and there in New England, following the great immigration from Old
England, from 1630-40, during the Commonwealth, and to the Restoration,
several cases<a name="pg025"></a> of witchcraft occurred, but the mania did not set its
seal on the minds of men, and inspire them to run amuck in their frenzy,
until the days of the swift onset in Massachusetts and Connecticut in
1692, when the zenith of Satan's reign was reached in the Puritan
colonies.</p>

<p>A few words about the tragedy at Salem are relevant and essential. They
are written because it was the last outbreak of epidemic demonopathy
among the civilized peoples; it has been exploited by writers abroad,
who have left the dreadful record of the treatment of the delusion in
their own countries in the background; it was accompanied in some degree
by like manifestations and methods of suppression in sister colonies; it
was fanned into flames by men in high station who reveled in its
merciless extirpation as a religious duty, and eased their consciences
afterwards by contrition, confession and remorse, for their valiant
service in the army of the theological devil; and especially for the
contrasts it presents to the more cautious and saner methods of
procedure that obtained in the governments of Connecticut and New Haven
at the apogee of the delusion.</p>

<p>What say the historians and scholars, some of whose ancestors witnessed
or participated in the tragedies, and whose acquaintance with the facts
defies all challenge?</p>

<p>&quot;It is on the whole the most gruesome episode in American history, and
it sheds back a lurid light upon the long tale of witchcraft in the
past.&quot; (<i>Fiske's New France and New England</i>, 195.)</p>

<p>&quot;The sainted minister in the church; the woman of the scarlet letter in
the market place! What imagination <a name="pg026"></a>would have been irreverent enough to
surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both.&quot; (<i>Scarlet
Letter</i>, HAWTHORNE.)</p>

<p>&quot;We are made partners in parish and village feuds. We share in the
chimney corner gossip, and learn for the first time how many mean and
merely human motives, whether consciously or unconsciously, gave impulse
and intensity to the passions of the actors in that memorable tragedy
which dealt the death blow in this country to the belief in Satanic
compacts.&quot; (<i>Among my Books&mdash;Witchcraft</i>, p. 142, LOWELL.)</p>

<p>&quot;The tragedy was at an end. It lasted about six months, from the first
accusations in March until the last executions in September.... It was
an epidemic of mad superstitious fear, bitterly to be regretted, and a
stain upon the high civilization of the Bay Colony.&quot; (<i>Historic Towns of
New England, Salem</i>, p. 148, LATIMER.)</p>

<p>What was done at Salem, when the tempest of unreason broke loose? Who
were the chief actors in it? This was done. From the first accusation in
March, 1692, to the last execution in September, 1692, nineteen persons
were hanged and one man was pressed to death<a name="fnanchorD4"></a><a href="#footnoteD4">[D]</a> (<i>no witch was ever
burned in New England</i>), hundreds of innocent men and women were
imprisoned, or fled into exile or hiding places, their homes were broken
up, their estates were ruined, and their families and friends were left
in sorrow, anxiety, and desolation; and all this terrorism was wrought
at the instance of the chief men in the communities, the magistrates,
and the ministers.</p>

<p><a name="footnoteD4"></a><a href="#fnanchorD4">[D]</a> Fifty-five persons suffered torture, and twenty were
executed before the delusion ended. <i>Ency. Americana</i> (Vol. 16,
&quot;Witchcraft&quot;).</p>

<p><a name="pg027"></a>Upham in his <i>Salem Witchcraft</i> (Vol. II. pp. 249-250) thus pictures
the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;The prisons in Salem, Ipswich, Boston, and Cambridge, were crowded. All
the securities of society were dissolved. Every man's life was at the
mercy of every man. Fear sat on every countenance, terror and distress
were in all hearts, silence pervaded the streets; all who could, quit
the country; business was at a stand; a conviction sunk into the minds
of men, that a dark and infernal confederacy had got foot-hold in the
land, threatening to overthrow and extirpate religion and morality, and
establish the kingdom of the Prince of darkness in a country which had
been dedicated, by the prayers and tears and sufferings of its pious
fathers, to the Church of Christ and the service and worship of the true
God. The feeling, dismal and horrible indeed, became general, that the
providence of God was removed from them; that Satan was let loose, and
he and his confederates had free and unrestrained power to go to and
fro, torturing and destroying whomever he willed.&quot;</p>

<p>The trials were held by a Special Court, consisting of William
Stoughton, Peter Sergeant, Nath. Saltonstall, Wait Winthrop, Bartho'
Gedney, John Richards, Saml. Sewall, John Hathorne, Tho. Newton, and
Jonathan Corwin,&mdash;not one of them a lawyer.</p>

<p>Whatever his associates may have thought of their ways of doing God's
service, after the tragedy was over, Sewall, one of the most zealous of
the justices, made a public confession of his errors before the
congregation of the Old South Church, January 14, 1697. Were the
agonizing groans of poor old Giles Corey, pressed to death under <a name="pg028"></a>planks
weighted with stones, or the prayers of the saintly Burroughs ringing in
his ears?</p>

<p>&quot;The conduct of Judge Sewall claims our particular admiration. He
observed annually in private a day of humiliation and prayer, during the
remainder of his life, to keep fresh in his mind a sense of repentance
and sorrow for the part he bore in the trials. On the day of the general
fast, he arose in the place where he was accustomed to worship, the old
South, in Boston, and in the presence of the great assembly, handed up
to the pulpit a written confession, acknowledging the error into which
he had been led, praying for the forgiveness of God and his people, and
concluding with a request, to all the congregation to unite with him in
devout supplication, that it might not bring down the displeasure of the
Most High upon his country, his family, or himself. He remained standing
during the public reading of the paper. This was an act of true
manliness and dignity of soul.&quot; (<i>Upham's Salem Witchcraft</i>, Vol. II, p.
441).</p>

<p>Grim, stern, narrow as he was, this man in his self-judgment commands
the respect of all true men.</p>

<p>The ministers stood with the magistrates in their delusion and
intemperate zeal. Two hundred and sixteen years after the last witch was
hung in Massachusetts a clearer light falls on one of the striking
personalities of the time&mdash;Cotton Mather&mdash;who to a recent date has been
credited with the chief responsibility for the Salem prosecutions.</p>

<p>Did he deserve it?</p>

<p>Robert Calef, in his <i>More Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, Bancroft in
his <i>History of the United States</i>, <a name="pg029"></a>and Charles W. Upham in his <i>Salem
Witchcraft</i>, are the chief writers who have placed Mather in the
foreground of those dreadful scenes, as the leading minister of the
time, an active personal participant in the trials and executions, and a
zealot in the maintenance of the ministerial dignity and domination.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the learned scholar, the late William Frederick
Poole, first in the <i>North American Review</i>, in 1869, and again in his
paper <i>Witchcraft in Boston</i>, in 1882, in the <i>Memorial History of
Boston</i>, calls Calef an immature youth, and says that his obvious
intent, and that of the several unknown contributors who aided him, was
to malign the Boston ministers and to make a sensation.</p>

<p>And the late John Fiske, in his <i>New France and New England</i> (p. 155),
holds that:</p>

<p>&quot;Mather's rules (of evidence) would not have allowed a verdict of guilty
simply upon the drivelling testimony of the afflicted persons, and if
this wholesome caution had been observed, not a witch would ever have
been hung in Salem.&quot;</p>

<p>What were those rules of evidence and of procedure attributed to Mather?
Through the Special Court appointed to hold the witch trials, and early
in its sittings, the opinions of twelve ministers of Boston and vicinity
were asked as to witchcraft. Cotton Mather wrote and his associates
signed an answer June 15, 1692, entitled, <i>The Return of Several
Ministers Consulted by his Excellency and the Honorable Council upon the
Present Witchcrafts in Salem Village</i>. This was the opinion of the
ministers, and it is most important to note what is <a name="pg030"></a>said in it of
spectral evidence,<a name="fnanchorE5"></a><a href="#footnoteE5">[E]</a> as it was upon such evidence that many convictions
were had:</p>

<p>&quot;1. The afflicted state of our poor neighbors that are now suffering by
molestations from the Invisible World we apprehend so deplorable, that
we think their condition calls for the utmost help of all persons in
their several capacities.</p>

<p>&quot;2. We cannot but with all thankfulness acknowledge the success which
the merciful God has given unto the sedulous and assiduous endeavors of
our honorable rulers to detect the abominable witchcrafts which have
been committed in the country; humbly praying that the discovery of
these mysterious and mischievous wickednesses may be perfected.</p>

<p>&quot;3. We judge that, in the prosecution of these and all such witchcrafts
there is need of a very critical and exquisite caution, lest by too much
credulity for things received only upon the devil's authority, there be
a door opened for a long train of miserable consequences, and Satan get
an advantage over us; for we should not be ignorant of his devices.</p>

<p>&quot;4. As in complaints upon witchcraft there may be matters of inquiry
which do not amount unto matters of presumption, and there may be
matters of presumption which yet may not be matters of conviction, so it
is necessary <a name="pg031"></a>that all proceedings thereabout be managed with an
exceeding tenderness toward those that may be complained of, especially
if they have been persons formerly of an unblemished reputation.</p>

<p>&quot;5. When the first inquiry is made into the circumstances of such as
may lie under the just suspicion of witchcrafts, we could wish that
there may be admitted as little as possible of such noise, company and
openness as may too hastily expose them that are examined, and that
there may be nothing used as a test for the trial of the suspected, the
lawfulness whereof may be doubted by the people of God, but that the
directions given by such judicious writers as Perkins and Barnard may be
observed.</p>

<p>&quot;6. Presumptions whereupon persons may be committed, and much more,
convictions whereupon persons may be condemned as guilty of witchcrafts,
ought certainly to be more considerable than barely the accused persons
being represented by a spectre unto the afflicted, inasmuch as it is an
undoubted and notorious thing that a demon may by God's permission
appear even to ill purposes, in the shape of an innocent, yea, and a
virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made in the sufferers, by a
look or touch of the accused, to be an infallible evidence of guilt, but
frequently liable to be abused by the devil's legerdemains.</p>

<p>&quot;7. We know not whether some remarkable affronts given the devils, by
our disbelieving these testimonies whose whole force and strength is
from them alone, may not put a period unto the progress of the dreadful
calamity begun upon us, in the accusation of so many persons <a name="pg032"></a>whereof
some, we hope, are yet clear from the great transgression laid to their
charge.</p>

<p>&quot;8. Nevertheless, we cannot but humbly recommend unto the government,
the speedy and vigorous prosecutions of such as have rendered themselves
obnoxious, according to the directions given in the laws of God and the
wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of
witchcrafts.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="footnoteE5"></a><a href="#fnanchorE5">[E]</a> An illustration: The child Ann Putnam, in her testimony
against the Rev. Mr. Burroughs, said that one evening the apparition of
a minister came to her and asked her to write her name in the devil's
book. Then came the forms of two women in winding sheets, and looked
angrily upon the minister and scolded him until he was fain to vanish
away. Then the women told Ann that they were the ghosts of Mr.
Burroughs' first and second wives whom he had murdered.</p>

<p>Did Longfellow, after a critical study of the original evidence and
records, truly interpret Mather's views, in his dialogue with Hathorne?</p>

MATHER:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Remember this, That as a sparrow falls not to the ground</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sifted the matter thoroughly through and through,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then resifted it.&quot;</span><br />

MATHER:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;If God permits</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">These evil spirits from the unseen regions</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To visit us with surprising informations,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We must inquire what cause there is for this,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But not receive the testimony borne</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By spectres as conclusive proof of guilt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the accused.&quot;</span><br />
<a name="pg033"></a>
HATHORNE:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Upon such evidence</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We do not rest our case. The ways are many</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In which the guilty do betray themselves.&quot;</span><br />

MATHER:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Be careful, carry the knife with such exactness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That on one side no innocent blood be shed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By too excessive zeal, and on the other</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No shelter given to any work of darkness.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>New England Tragedies</i> (4, 725), LONGFELLOW.</span><br />

<p>Whatever Mather's caution to the court may have been, or his leadership
in learning, or his ambition and his clerical zeal, there is thus far no
evidence, in all his personal participation in the tragedies, that he
lifted his hand to stay the storm of terrorism once begun, or cried halt
to the magistrates in their relentless work. On the contrary, after six
victims had been executed, August 4, 1692, in <i>A Discourse on the
Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, Mather wrote this in deliberate, cool
afterthought:</p>

<p>&quot;They&mdash;the judges&mdash;have used as judges have heretofore done, the
spectral evidences, to introduce their farther inquiries into the lives
of the persons accused; and they have thereupon, by the wonderful
Providence of God, been so strengthened with other evidences that some
of the witch-gang have been fairly executed.&quot;</p>

<p>And a year later, in the light of all his personal experience and
investigation, Mather solemnly declared:</p>

<p>&quot;If in the midst of the many dissatisfactions among us, the publication
of these trials may promote such a pious <a name="pg034"></a>thankfulness unto God for
justice being so far executed among us, I shall rejoice that God is
glorified.&quot;</p>

<p>Wherever the responsibility at Salem may have rested, the truth is that
in the general fear and panic there was potent in the minds, both of the
clergy and the laity, the spirit of fanaticism and malevolence in some
instances, such as misled the pastor of the First Church to point to the
corpses of Giles Corey's devoted and saintly wife and others swinging to
and fro, and say &quot;What a sad thing it is to see eight firebrands of hell
hanging there.&quot;</p>

<p>This conspectus of witchcraft, old and new, of its development from the
sorcery and magic of the ancients into the medi&aelig;val theological dogma
of the power of Satan, of its gradual ripening into an epidemic
demonopathy, of its slow growth in the American colonies, of its
volcanic outburst in the close of the seventeenth century, is relevant
and appropriate to this account of the delusion in Connecticut, its rise
and suppression, its firm hold on the minds and consciences of the
colonial leaders for threescore years after the settlement of the towns,
a chapter in Connecticut history written in the presence of the actual
facts now made known and available, and with a purpose of historic
accuracy.</p>

<a name="chap5"></a><h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;It was not to be expected of the colonists of New England
  that they should be the first to see through a delusion which befooled the whole
  civilized world, and the gravest and most knowing persons in it. The colonists
  in Connecticut and New Haven, as well as in Massachusetts, like all other Christian
  people at that time&mdash;at least with extremely rare individual exceptions&mdash;believed
  in the reality of a hideous crime called witchcraft.&quot; PALFREY'S <i>New

<p><font size="-1">&quot;The truth is that it [witchcraft] pervaded the whole

<p><font size="-1">&quot;One ---- of Windsor Arraigned and Executed at Hartford
  for a Witch.&quot; WINTHROP'S <i>Journal</i> (2: 374, Savage Ed., 1853).</font></p>
<br />

<p>Here beginneth the first chapter of the story of the delusion in
Connecticut. It is an entry made by John Winthrop, Governor of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony, in his famous journal, without specific date,
but probably in the spring of 1647.</p>

<p>It is of little consequence save as much has been made of it by some
writers as fixing the relative date of the earliest execution for
witchcraft in New England, and locating it in one of the three original
Connecticut towns.</p>

<p>What matters it at this day whether Mary Johnson as tradition runs, or
Alse Youngs as truth has it, was put to death for witchcraft in Windsor,
Connecticut, in 1647, or Martha Jones of Charlestown, Massachusetts, was
<a name="pg036"></a>hung for the same crime at Boston in 1648, as also set down in
Winthrop's Journal?</p>

<p>&quot;It may possibly be thought a great neglect, or matter of partiality,
that no account is given of witchcraft in Connecticut. The only reason
is, that after the most careful researches, no indictment of any person
for that crime, nor any process relative to that affair can be found.&quot;
(<i>History of Connecticut</i>, 1799, Preface, BENJAMIN TRUMBULL, D.D.)</p>

<p>&quot;A few words should be said regarding the author's mention of the
subject of witchcraft in Connecticut.... It is, I believe, strictly
true, as he says 'that no indictment of any person for that crime nor
any process relative to that affair can be found.'</p>

<p>&quot;It must be confessed, however, that a careful study of the official
colonial records of Connecticut and New Haven leaves no doubt that
Goodwife Bassett was convicted and hung at Stratford for witchcraft in
1651, and Goodwife Knapp at Fairfield in 1653. It is also recorded in
Winthrop's <i>Journal</i> that 'One ---- of Windsor was arraigned and executed
at Hartford for a witch' in March, 1646-47, which if it actually
occurred, forms the first instance of an execution for witchcraft in New
England. The quotation here given is the only known authority for the
statement, and opens the question whether something probably recorded as
hearsay in a journal, may be taken as authoritative evidence of an
occurrence.... The fact however remains, that the official records are
as our author says, silent regarding the actual proceedings, and it is
only by inference that it may be found from these records that the
executions took place.&quot; (Introduction <a name="pg037"></a>to Reprint of <i>Trumbull's History
of Connecticut</i>, 1898, JONATHAN TRUMBULL.)</p>

<p>The searcher for inerrant information about witchcraft in Connecticut
may easily be led into a maze of contradictions, and the statement last
above quoted is an apt illustration, with record evidence to the
contrary on every hand. Tradition, hearsay, rumor, misstatements,
errors, all colored by ignorance or half knowledge, or a local jealousy
or pride, have been woven into a woof of precedent and acceptance, and
called history.</p>

<p>As has been already stated, the general writers from Trumbull to
Johnston have nothing of value to say on the subject; the open official
records and the latest history&mdash;<i>Connecticut as a Colony and a
State</i>&mdash;cover only certain cases, and nowhere from the beginning to this
day has the story of witchcraft been fully told.</p>

<p>Connecticut can lose nothing in name or fame or honor, if, more than two
centuries after the last witch was executed within her borders, the
facts as to her share in the strange superstition be certified from the
current records of the events.</p>

<p>How may this story best be told? Clearly, so far as may be, in the very
words of the actors in those tragic scenes, in the words of the minister
and magistrate, the justice and the juryman, the accuser and the
accused, and the searcher. Into this court of inquiry come all these
personalities to witness the sorrowful march of the victims to the
scaffold or to exile, or to acquittal and deliverance with the after
life of suspicion and social ostracism.</p>

<p>The spectres of terror did not sit alone at the firesides<a name="pg038"></a> of the poor
and lowly: they stalked in high places, and were known of men and women
of the first rank in education and the social virtues, and of greatest
influence in church and state.</p>

<p>Of this fact there is complete demonstration in a glance at the
dignitaries who presided at one of the earliest witchcraft trials&mdash;men
of notable ancestry, of learning, of achievements, leaders in colonial
affairs, whose memories are honored to this day.</p>

<p>These were the magistrates at a session entitled &quot;A particular courte in
Hartford upon the tryall of John Carrington and his wife 20th Feb., 1662&quot;
(See <i>Rec. P.C.</i>, 2: 17): Edw. Hopkins Esqr., Gournor John Haynes Esqr.
Deputy, Mr. Wells, Mr. Woolcott, Mr. Webster, Mr. Cullick, Mr. Clarke.</p>

<p>This court had jurisdiction over misdemeanors, and was &quot;aided by a
jury,&quot; as a close student of colonial history, the late Sherman W.
Adams, quaintly says in one of his historical papers. These were the
jurymen:</p>

<br />

<p>Before this tribunal&mdash;representative of the others doing like service
later&mdash;made up of the foremost citizens, and of men in the ordinary
walks of life, endowed with hard common sense and presumably inspired
with a spirit of justice and fair play, came John Carrington and his
wife Joan of Wethersfield, against whom the jury brought in a verdict of
guilty.</p>

<p><a name="pg039"></a>It must be clearly borne in mind that all these men, in this as in all
the other witchcraft trials in Connecticut, illustrious or
commonplace&mdash;as are many of their descendants whose names are written on
the rolls of the patriotic societies in these days of ancestral
discovery and exploitation&mdash;were absolute believers in the powers of
Satan and his machinations through witchcraft and the evidence then
adduced to prove them, and trained to such credulity by their education
and experience, by their theological doctrines, and by the law of the
land in Old England, but still clothed upon with that righteousness
which as it proved in the end made them skeptical as to certain alleged
evidences of guilt, and swift to respond to the calls of reason and of
mercy when the appeals were made to their calm judgment and second
thought as to the sins of their fellowmen.</p>

<p>In no way can the truth be so clearly set forth, the real character of
the evidence be so justly appreciated upon which the convictions were
had, as from the depositions and the oral testimony of the witnesses
themselves. They are lasting memorials to the credulity and
superstition, and the religious insanity which clouded the senses of the
wisest men for a time, and to the malevolence and satanic ingenuity of
the people who, possessed of the devil accused their friends and
neighbors of a crime punishable by death.</p>

<p>Nor is this dark chapter in colonial history without its flashes of
humor and ridiculousness, as one follows the absurd and unbridled
testimonies which have been chosen as completely illustrative of the
whole series in the years of the witchcraft nightmare. They are in part
cited here, <a name="pg040"></a>for the sake of authenticity and exactness, as written out
in the various court records and depositions, published and unpublished,
in the ancient style of spelling, and are worthy the closest study for
many reasons.</p>

<p>It will, however, clear the way to a better understanding of the unique
testimonies of the witch witnesses, if there be first presented the
authoritative reasons for the examination of a witch, coupled with a
summary of the lawful tests of innocence or guilt. They are in the
handwriting of William Jones, a Deputy Governor of Connecticut and a
member of the court at some of the trials.</p>

<p>GROUNDS FOR EXAMINATION OF A WITCH</p>

<p>&quot;1. Notorious defamacon by ye common report of the people a ground of
suspicion.</p>

<p>&quot;2. Second ground for strict examinacon is if a fellow witch gave
testimony on his examinacon or death yt such a pson is a witch, but this
is not sufficient for conviccon or condemnacon.</p>

<p>&quot;3. If after cursing, there follow death or at least mischiefe to ye
party.</p>

<p>&quot;4. If after quarrelling or threatening a prsent mischiefe doth follow
for ptye's devilishly disposed after cursing doe use threatnings, &amp; yt
alsoe is a grt prsumcon agt y.</p>

<p>&quot;5. If ye pty suspected be ye son or daughter, the serv't or familiar
friend, neer neighbors or old companion of a knowne or convicted witch
this alsoe is a prsumcon, for witchcraft is an art yt may be larned &amp;
covayd from man to man &amp; oft it falleth out yt a witch dying leaveth som
of ye aforesd heires of her witchcraft.</p>

<p>&quot;6. If ye pty suspected have ye devills mark for t'is thought wn ye
devill maketh his covent with y he alwayess leaves his mark behind him
to know y for his owne yt <a name="pg041"></a>is, if noe evident reason in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be given
for such mark.</p>

<p>&quot;7. Lastly if ye pty examined be unconstant &amp; contrary to himselfe in

and unwarrantable and worse. Although casting into ye water is by some
justified for ye witch having made a ct wth ye devill she hath renounced
her baptm &amp; hence ye antipathy between her &amp; water, but this he makes
nothing off. Anothr insufficient testimoy of a witch is ye testimony of
a wizard, who prtends to show ye face of ye witch to ye party afflicted
in a glass, but this he counts diabolicall &amp; dangerous, ye devill may
reprsent a pson inocent. Nay if after curses &amp; threats mischiefe follow
or if a sick pson like to dy take it on his death such a one has
bewitched him, there are strong grounds of suspicon for strict examinacon
but not sufficient for conviccon.</p>

<p>&quot;And ye reasons why ye devill would discover y is 1 his malice towards

prsumtions wthout good &amp; sufficient proofes.</p>

<p>&quot;But if convicted of yt horrid crime to be put to death, for God hath
said thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot;</p>

<p>The accuser and the prosecutor were aided in their work in a peculiar
way. It was the theory and belief that every witch was marked&mdash;very
privately marked&mdash;by the Devil, and the marks could only be discovered
by a personal examination. And thus there came into the service of the
courts a servant known as a &quot;searcher,&quot; usually a woman, as most of the
unfortunates who were accused were women.</p>

<p><a name="pg043"></a>The location and identification of the witch marks involved revolting
details, some of the reports being unprintable. It is, however,
indispensable to a right understanding of the delusion and the popular
opinions which made it possible, that these incidents, abhorrent and
nauseating as they are, be given within proper limitations to meet
inquiry&mdash;not curiosity&mdash;and because they may be noted in various
records.</p>

<p>A standard authority in legal procedure in England, recognized in
witchcraft prosecutions in the New England colonies, was <i>Dalton's
Country Justice</i>, first published in 1619 in England, and in its last
edition in 1746.</p>

<p>In its chapter on Witchcraft are these directions as to the witch marks:</p>

<p>&quot;These witches have ordinarily a familiar, or spirit which appeareth to
them, sometimes in one shape and sometimes in another; as in the shape
of a man, woman, boy, dog, cat, foal, hare, rat, toad, etc. And to these
their spirits, they give names, and they meet together to christen them
(as they speak).... And besides their sucking the Devil leaveth other
marks upon their body, sometimes like a blue or red spot, like a
flea-biting, sometimes the flesh sunk in and hollow. And these Devil's
marks be insensible, and being pricked will not bleed, and be often in
their secretest parts, and therefore require diligent and careful
search. These first two are main points to discover and convict those
witches.&quot;</p>

<p>These methods were adopted in the proceedings against witches in
Connecticut, and it will suffice to cite one of the reports of a
committee&mdash;Sarah Burr, Abigail Burr, Abigail Howard, Sarah Wakeman, and
Hannah Wilson,&mdash;&quot;<a name="pg044"></a>apointed (by the court) to make sarch upon ye bodis of
Marcy Disbrough and Goodwif Clauson,&quot; at Fairfield, in September and
October 1692, sworn to before Jonathan Bell, Commissioner, and John
Allyn, Secretary.</p>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;Remembering all this, it is not surprising that witches
  were tried, convicted and put to death in New England; and the manner in which
  the waning superstition was dealt with by Connecticut lawyers and ministers
  is the more significant of that robust common sense, rejection of superstition,
  political and religious, and fearless acceptance of the ethical mandates of
  the great Law-giver, which influenced the growth of their jurisprudence and
  stamped it with an unmistakable individuality.&quot; <i>Connecticut; Origin

  and desire for social solidarity. That this was wrong and mischievous is granted;
  but it is ordinary human conduct now as then. It was a most illogical, capricious,
  and dangerous form of enforcing punishment, abating nuisances, and shutting
  out disagreeable truths; fertile in injustice, oppression, the shedding of innocent
  blood, and the extinguishing of light. No one can justify it, or plead beneficial
  results from it which could not have been secured with far less evil in other
  ways. But it was natural that, believing the crime to exist, they should use

<br />

<p>An accusation of witchcraft was a serious matter, one of life or death,
and often it was safer to become an accuser than one of the accused.
Made in terror, malice, mischief, revenge, or religious dementia, or of
some other <a name="pg046"></a>ingredients in the Devil's brew, it passed through the
stages of suspicion, espionage, watchings, and searchings, to the formal
complaints and indictments which followed the testimony of the
witnesses, in their madness and delusion hot-foot to tell the story of
their undoing, their grotesque imaginings, their spectral visions, their
sufferings at the hands of Satan and his tools, and all aimed at people,
their neighbors and acquaintances, often wholly innocent, but having
marked personal peculiarities, or of irregular lives by the Puritan
standard, or unpopular in their communities, who were made the victim of
one base passion or another and brought to trial for a capital offense
against person and property.</p>

<p>Taking into account the actual number of accusations, trials, and
convictions or acquittals, the number of witnesses called and
depositions given was very great. And the later generations owe their
opportunity to judge aright in the matter, to the foresight of the men
of chief note in the communities who saw the vital necessity of record
evidence, and so early as 1666, in the General Court of Connecticut, it
was ordered that</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever testimonies are improved in any court of justice in this
corporation in any action or case to be tried, shall be presented in
writing, and so kept by the secretary or clerk of the said court on
file.&quot;</p>

<p>This preliminary analysis brings the searcher for the truth face to face
with the very witnesses who have left behind them, in the attested
records, the ludicrous or solemn, the pitiable or laughable memorials of
their own folly, delusion, or deviltry, which marked them then and now
as Satan's chosen servitors.</p>

<p><a name="pg047"></a>Among the many witnesses and their statements on oath now made
available, the chief difficulty is one of selection and elimination; and
there will be presented here with the context some of the chief
depositions<a name="fnanchorF6"></a><a href="#footnoteF6">[F]</a> and statements in the most notable witchcraft trials in
some of the Connecticut towns, that are typical of all of them, and show
upon what travesties of evidence the juries found their verdicts and the
courts imposed their sentences.</p>


<p><a name="footnoteF6"></a><a href="#fnanchorF6">[F]</a> The selected testimonies herein given are from the
Connecticut and New Haven colonial records; from the original
depositions in some of the witchcraft cases, in manuscript, a part of
the <i>Wyllys Papers</i>, so called, now in the Connecticut State Library;
and from the notes and papers on witchcraft of the late Charles J.
Hoadley, LL.D., compiler of the colonial and state records, and for
nearly a half century the state librarian.</p>

<p><strong>KATHERINE (KATERAN) HARRISON</strong></p>

<p>At a Court of Assistants held at Hartford May 11, 1669, presided over by
Maj. John Mason&mdash;the conqueror of the Pequots&mdash;then Deputy Governor,
Katherine Harrison, after an examination by the court on a charge of
suspicion of witchcraft, was committed to the common jail, to be kept in
durance until she came to trial and deliverance by the law.</p>

<p>At an adjourned session of the court at Hartford, May 25, 1669, presided
over by John Winthrop, Governor, with William Leete, Deputy Governor,
Major Mason and others as assistants, an indictment was found against
the prisoner in these words:</p>

<p>&quot;Kateran Harrison thou standest here indicted by ye name of Kateran
Harrison (of Wethersfield) as being <a name="pg048"></a>guilty of witchcraft for that thou
not haueing the fear of God before thine eyes hast had familiaritie with
Sathan the grand enemie of god and mankind and by his help hast acted
things beyond and beside the ordinary course of nature and hast thereby
hurt the bodyes of divers of the subjects of or souraigne Lord the King
of which by the law of god and of this corporation thou oughtest to
dye.&quot;</p>

<p>Katherine plead not guilty and &quot;refered herself to a tryall by the jury
present,&quot; to whom this solemn oath was administered:</p>

<p>&quot;You doe sware by the great and dreadful name of the everliuing god that
you will well and truely try just verdict give and true deliverance make
between or Souraigne Lord the King and such prisoner or prisoners at the
barr as shall be given you in charge according to the Evidence given in
Court and the lawes so help you god in or lord Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>A partial trial was had at the May session of the court, but the jury
could not agree upon a verdict, and adjournment was had until the
October session, when a verdict was to be given in, and the prisoner was
remanded to remain in prison in the meantime.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that men like Winthrop and Mason, Treat and Leete,
and others of the foremost rank in those days, could have served as
judges in such trials, and in all earnestness and sincerity listened to
and given credence to the drivel, the travesties of common sense, the
mockeries of truth, which fell from the lips of the witnesses in their
testimonies. Some of the absurd charges against Katherine Harrison
invite particular attention and need no comment. They speak for
themselves.</p>

<p><strong>THOMAS BRACY</strong> (probably Tracy)&mdash;<i>Misfit jacket and breeches&mdash;Vision
  of the red calf's head&mdash;Murderous counsel&mdash;&quot;Afflictinge&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;Thomas Bracy aged about 31 years testifieth as follows that formerly
James Wakeley would haue borrowed a saddle of the saide Thomas Bracy,
which Thomas Bracy denyed to lend to him, he threatened Thomas and
saide, it had bene better he had lent it to him. Allsoe Thomas Bracy
beinge at worke the same day making a jacket &amp; a paire of breeches, he
labored to his best understanding to set on the sleeues aright on the
jacket and seauen tymes he placed the sleues wronge, setting the elbow
on the wronge side and was faine to rip them of and new set them on
againe, and allsoe the breeches goeing to cut out the breeches, haueing
two peices of cloth of different collors, he was soe bemoydered in the
matter, that he cut the breeches one of one collor the other off another
collor, in such a manner he was bemoydered in his understandinge or
actinge yet neuertheless the same daie and tyme he was well in his
understandinge and health in other matters and soe was forced to leaue
workinge that daie.</p>

<p>&quot;The said Thomas beinge at Sargant Hugh Wells his house ouer against
John Harrison's house, in Weathersfield, he saw a cart cominge towards
John Harrisons house loaden wth hay, on the top of the hay he saw
perfectly a red calfes head, the eares standing peart up, and keeping
his sight on the cart tell the cart came to the barne, the calfe
vanised, and Harrison stoode on the carte wch appared not to Thomas
before, nor could Thomas find or see any calfe theire at all though he
sought to see the calfe.</p>

<p>&quot;After this Thomas Bracy giuing out some words, that <a name="pg050"></a>he suspected
Katherin Gooddy Harrison of witchcraft, Katherin Harrison mett Thomas
Bracy and threatned Thomas telling him that shee would be euen with him.
After that Thomas Bracy aforesaide, being well in his sences &amp; health
and perfectly awake, his brothers in bed with him, Thomas aforesaid saw
the saide James Wakely and the saide Katherin Harrison stand by his bed
side, consultinge to kill him the said Thomas, James Wakely said he
would cut his throate, but Katherin counselled to strangle him,
presently the said Katherin seised on Thomas striuinge to strangle him,
and pulled or pinched him so as if his flesh had been pulled from his
bones, theirefore Thomas groaned. At length his father Marten heard and
spake, then Thomas left groninge and lay quiet a little, and then
Katherin fell againe to afflictinge and pinching, Thomas againe groninge
Mr. Marten heard and arose and came to Thomas whoe could not speake till
Mr. Marten laid his hands on Thomas, then James and Katherin aforesaid
went to the beds feete, his father Marten and his mother stayed
watchinge by Thomas all that night after, and the next day Mr. Marten
and his wife saw the mark of the saide afflictinge and pinchinge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The deposition of Joseph Dickenson of Northampton, <a name="pg051"></a>aged about 32 years,
testifieth that he and Philip Smith of Hadley went down early in the
morninge to the greate dry swampe, and theire we heard a voice call
Hoccanum, Hoccanum, Come Hoccanum, and coming further into the swampe
wee see that it was Katherin Harrison that caled as before. We saw
Katherin goe from thence homewards. The said Philip parted from Joseph,
and a small tyme after Joseph met Philip againe, and then the said
Philip affirmed that he had seene Katherin's cows neare a mile from the
place where Katherin called them. The saide Joseph went homewards, and
goeing homeward met Samuell Bellden ridinge into or downe the meadow.
Samuel Belden asked Joseph wheather he had seene the saide Katherin
Harrison &amp; the saide Samuel told Joseph aforesaide that he saw her neare
the meadow gate, going homeward, and allso more told him that he saw
Katherin Harrison her cows runninge with greate violence, taile on end,
homewards, and said he thought the cattell would be at home soe soon as

with Goodwife Harrison in Weathersfield the saide Katherin Harrison
saide that a swarm of her beese flew away over her neighbour Boreman's
lott and into the great meadow, and thence over the greate <a name="pg052"></a>river to
Nabuck side, but the said Katherin saide that shee had fetched them
againe; this seemed very strange to the saide Richard, because this was

  on his neighbor's &quot;rowing&quot;&mdash;The cartrope adventure&mdash;The
  runaway oxen</i></p>

<p>&quot;John Graves aged about 39 years testifieth that formerly going to reap
in the meadow at Wethersfield, his land he was to work on lay near to
John Harrison's land. It came into the thoughts of the said John Graves
that the said John Harrison and Katherine his wife being rumored to be
suspicious of witchcraft, therefore he would graze his cattle on the
rowing of the land of goodman Harrison, thinking that if the said
Harrisons were witches then something would disturb the quiet feeding of
the cattle. He thereupon adventured and tied his oxen to his cart rope,
one to one end and the other to the other end, making the oxen surely
fast as he could, tieing 3 or 4 fast knots at each end, and tying his
yoke to the cartrope about the middle of the rope between the oxen; and
himself went about 10 or 12 pole distant, to see if the cattle would
quietly feed as in other places. The cattle stood staring and fed not,
and looking stedfastly on them he saw the cartrope of its own accord
untie and fall to the ground; thereupon he went and tied the rope more
fast and more knots in <a name="pg053"></a>it and stood apart as before to see the issue.
In a little time the oxen as affrighted fell to running, and ran with
such violence that he judgeth that the force and speed of their running
made the yoke so tied fly above six foot high to his best discerning.
The cattle were used ordinarily before to be so tied and fed&mdash;in other
places, &amp; presently after being so tied on other men's ground they
fed&mdash;peaceably as at other times.&quot; Dated August, 1668. Hadley; taken

<p><strong>JOANE FRANCIS</strong>&mdash;<i>The sick child&mdash;The spectre</i></p>

November, in the night just before my child was struck ill, goodwife
Harrison or her shape appeared, and I said, the Lord bless me and my
child, here is goody Harrison. And the child lying on the outside I took
it and laid it between me and my husband. The child continued strangely
ill about three weeks, wanting a day, and then died, had fits. We felt a
thing run along the sides or side like a whetstone. Robert Francis saith

husband was employed by goodman Harrison to go to Windsor with a canoe
for meal, and he told me as he lay in his bed at Windsor in the night he
had a <a name="pg054"></a>great box on the head, and after when he came home he was ill,
and goodwife Harrison did help him with diet drink and plasters, but
after a while we sent to Capt. Atwood to help my husband in his
distress, but the same day that he came at night I came in at the door,
&amp; to the best of my apprehension I saw the likeness of goodwife Harrison
with her face towards my husband, and I turned about to lock the door &amp;
she vanist away. Then my husband's nose fell a bleeding in an
extraordinary manner, &amp; so continued (if it were meddled with) to his
dying day. Sworn in court Oct. 29, 1668, attests John Allyn, Secy.&quot;</p>

<p>MARY HALE&mdash;Noises and blows&mdash;The canine apparition&mdash;The voice in the
night&mdash;The Devil a liar</p>

<p>&quot;That about the latter end of November, being the 29th day, 1668, the
said Mary Hale lying in her bed, a good fire giving such light that one
might see all over that room where the said Mary then was, the said Mary
heard a noise, &amp; presently something fell on her legs with such violence
that she feared it would have broken her legs, and then it came upon her
stomach and oppressed her so as if it would have pressed the breath out
of her body. Then appeared an ugly shaped thing like a dog, having a
head such that I clearly and distinctly knew to be the head of Katherine
Harrison, who was lately imprisoned upon suspicion of witchcraft. Mary
saw it walk to &amp; fro in the chamber and went to her father's bedside
then came back and disappeared. That day seven night next after, lying
in her bed something came upon her in like manner as is formerly
related, first on her legs &amp; feet &amp; then on her stomach, crushing &amp;
oppressing her very sore. She <a name="pg055"></a>put forth her hand to feel (because there
was no light in the room so as clearly to discern). Mary aforesaid felt
a face, which she judged to be a woman's face, presently then she had a
great blow on her fingers which pained her 2 days after, which she
complained of to her father &amp; mother, &amp; made her fingers black and blue.
During the former passages Mary called to her father &amp; mother but could
not wake them till it was gone. After this, the day of December in the
night, (the night being very windy) something came again and spoke thus
to her, saying to Mary aforesaid, You said that I would not come again,
but are you not afraid of me. Mary said, No. The voice replied I will
make you afraid before I have done with you; and then presently Mary was
crushed &amp; oppressed very much. Then Mary called often to her father and
mother, they lying very near. Then the voice said, Though you do call
they shall not hear till I am gone. Then the voice said, You said that I
preserved my cart to carry me to the gallows, but I will make it a dear
cart to you (which said words Mary remembered she had only spoke in
private to her sister a little before &amp; to no other.) Mary replied she
feared her not, because God had kept her &amp; would keep her still. The
voice said she had a commission to kill her. Mary asked, Who gave you
the commission? The voice replied God gave me the commission. Mary
replied, The Devil is a liar from the beginning for God will not give
commission to murder, therefore it must be from the devil. Then Mary was
again pressed very much. Then the voice said, You will make known these
things abroad when I am gone, but if you will promise me to keep these
aforesaid matters secret I <a name="pg056"></a>will come no more to afflict you. Mary
replied I will tell it abroad. Whereas the said Mary mentions divers
times in this former writing that she heard a voice, this said Mary
affirmeth that she did &amp; doth know that it was the voice of Katherine
Harrison aforesaid; and Mary aforesaid affirmeth that the substance of
the whole relation is truth.&quot; Sworn in Court May 25, 1669. Attest John

<p>Elizabeth Smith&mdash;<i>Neighborly criticism&mdash;Fortune telling&mdash;Spinning yarn</i></p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth the wife of Simon Smith of Thirty Mile Island testified that
Catherine was noted by her and the rest of the family to be a great or
notorious liar, a sabbath breaker, and one that told fortunes, and told
the said Elizabeth her fortune, that her husband's name should be Simon;
&amp; also told the said Elizabeth some other matters that did come to pass;
and also would oft speak and boast of her great familiarity with Mr.
Lilley, one that told fortunes and foretold many matters that in furture
times were to be accomplished. And also the said Katherine did often
spin so great a quantity of fine linen yarn as the said Elizabeth did
never know nor hear of any other woman that could spin so much. And
further, the said Elizabeth said that Capt. Cullick observing the evil
conversation in word and deed of the said Katherine turned her out of
his service, one reason was because the said Katherine told fortunes.&quot;
Taken upon oath Sept. 23, 1668 before John Allyn, Assistant.</p>

<p>On such evidence, October 12, 1669, the jury being called to give in
their verdict upon the indictment of <a name="pg057"></a>Katherine Harrison, returned that
they find the prisoner guilty of the indictment.</p>

<p>But meanwhile important things in the history of the case had come to
pass. Serious doubts arose in the minds of the magistrates as to
accepting the verdict, and in their dilemma they took counsel not only
of the law but of the gospel, and presented a series of questions to
certain ministers&mdash;the same expedient adopted by the court at Salem
twenty-three years later.</p>

<p>The answer of the ministers is in the handwriting of Rev. Gershom
Bulkeley of Wethersfield, the author of the unique treatise <i>Will and
Doom</i>. It was a remarkable paper as to preternatural apparitions, the
character of evidence for conviction, and its cautions as to its
acceptance. It was this:</p>

<p>&quot;The answer of some ministers to the questions pr-pounded to them by
the Honored Magistrates, Octobr 20, 1669. To ye 1st Quest whether a
plurality of witnesses be necessary, legally to evidence one and ye same
individual fact? Wee answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That if the proofe of the fact do depend wholly upon testimony, there
is then a necessity of a plurality of witnesses, to testify to one &amp; ye
same individual fact; &amp; without such a plurality, there can be no legall
evidence of it. Jno 8, 17. The testimony of two men is true; that is
legally true, or the truth of order. &amp; this Cht alledges to vindicate ye
sufficiency of the testimony given to prove that individual facte, that
he himselfe was ye Messias or Light of the World. Mat. 26, 59, 60.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the 2nd quest. Whether the preternatural apparitions of a person
legally proved, be a demonstration of <a name="pg058"></a>familiarity with ye devill? Wee
anser, that it is not the pleasure of ye Most High, to suffer the wicked
one to make an undistinguishable representation of any innocent person
in a way of doing mischiefe, before a plurality of witnesses. The reason
is because, this would utterly evacuate all human testimony; no man
could testify, that he saw this pson do this or that thing, for it might
be said, that it was ye devill in his shape.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the 3d &amp; 4th quests together: Whether a vitious pson foretelling
some future event, or revealing of a secret, be a demonstration of
familiarity with the devill? Wee say thus much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That those things, whither past, present or to come, which are indeed
secret, that is, cannot be knowne by human skill in arts, or strength of
reason arguing from ye corse of nature, nor are made knowne by divine
revelation either mediate or immediate, nor by information from man,
must needes be knowne (if at all) by information from ye devill: &amp; hence
the comunication of such things, in way of divination (the pson
prtending the certaine knowledge of them) seemes to us, to argue
familiarity with ye devill, in as much as such a pson doth thereby
declare his receiving the devills testimony, &amp; yeeld up himselfe as ye
devills instrument to comunicate the same to others.&quot;</p>

<p>And meanwhile Katherine herself had not been idle even in durance. With
a dignity becoming such a communication, and in a desperate hope that
justice and mercy might be meted out to her, she addressed a petition to
the court setting forth with unconscious pathos some of the wrongs and
sufferings she had endured in person and <a name="pg059"></a>estate; and one may well
understand why under such great provocation she told Michael Griswold
that he would hang her though he damned a thousand souls, and as for his
own soul it was damned long ago. Vigorous and emphatic words, for which
perhaps Katherine was punished enough, as she was adjudged to pay
Michael in two actions for slander, &pound;25 and costs in one and &pound;15 and
costs in the other.</p>

<p>This was Katherine's appeal:</p>

<p>Filed: Wid. Harrisons greuances presented to the court 6th of Octobr
1669.</p>

<p>&quot;A complaint of severall greiuances of the widow Harrisons which she
desires the honored court to take cognizance of and as far as maybe to
give her reliefe in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May it please this honored court, to have patience with mee a little:
having none to complain to but the Fathers of the Commonweale; and yet
meetting with many injurys, which necessitate mee to look out for some
releeife. I am told to present you with these few lines, as a relation
of the wrongs that I suffer, humbly crauing your serious consideration
of my state a widdow; of my wrongs, (wch I conceive are great) and that
as far as the rules of justice and equitie will allow, I may have right
and a due recompence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That that I would present to you in the first place is we had a yoke of
oxen one of wch spoyled at our stile before our doore, with blows upon
the backe and side, so bruised that he was altogether unserviceable;
about a fortnight or three weeks after the former, we had a cow spoyled,
her back broke and two of her ribs, nextly I had a heifer in my barne
yard, my ear mark of wch was cutt out and <a name="pg060"></a>other ear marks set on;
nextly I had a sow that had young pigs ear marked (in the stie) after
the same manner; nextly I had a cow at the side of my yard, her jaw bone
broke and one of her hoofs and a hole bored in her side, nextly I had a
three yeare old heifer in the meadow stuck with knife or some weapon and
wounded to death; nextly I had a cow in the street wounded in the bag as
she stood before my door, in the street, nextly I had a sow went out
into the woods, came home with ears luged and one of her hind legs cutt
offe, lastly my corne in Mile Meadow much damnified with horses, they
being staked upon it; it was wheat; All wch injurys, as they do sauor of
enemy so I hope they will be looked upon by this honored court according
to their natuer and judged according to there demerit, that so your poor
suppliant may find some redrese; who is bold to subscribe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your servant and supplyant,
&quot;KATHERINE HARRISON.</p>

<p>&quot;Postscript. I had my horse wounded in the night, as he was in my
pasture no creature save thre calves with him: More I had one two yeare
old steer the back of it broke, in the barne yard, more I had a matter
of 30 poles of hops cutt and spoyled; all wch things have hapened since
my husband death, wch was last August was two yeare. There is wittnes to
the oxen Jonathan &amp; Josiah Gillert; to the cows being spoyled, Enoch
Buck, Josiah Gilbert; to the cow that had her jaw bone broke, Dan, Rose,
John, Bronson: to the heifer, one of widdow Stodder sons, and Willia
Taylor; to the corne John Beckly; to the wound of the horse Anthony
Wright, Goodman Higby; to the hops cutting, Goodwife Standish and Mary
<a name="pg061"></a>Wright; wch things being added, and left to your serious consideration,
I make bold again to subscribe.</p>

<p>&quot;Yours,
&quot;KATHERINE HARRISON.&quot;</p>

<p>At a special court of assistants held May 20, 1670, to which the General
Assembly had referred the matter with power, the court having considered
the verdict of the jury could not concur with them so as to sentence her
to death, but dismissed her from her imprisonment, she paying her just
fees; willing her to mind the fulfilment of removing from Wethersfield,
&quot;which is that will tend most to her own safety &amp; the contentment of the
people who are her neighbors.&quot;</p>

<p>In the same year, having paid the expenses of her trials and
imprisonment, she removed to Westchester, New York. Being under
suspicion of witchcraft, her presence was unwelcome to the inhabitants
there and complaint was made to Governor Lovelace. She gave security for
her civil carriage and good behavior, and at the General Court of
Assizes held in New York in October, 1670, in the case of Katherine
Harrison, widow, who was bound to the good behavior upon complaint of
some of the inhabitants of Westchester, it was ordered, &quot;that in regard
there is nothing appears against her deserving the continuance of that
obligation she is to be released from it, &amp; hath liberty to remain in
the town of Westchester where she now resides, or anywhere else in the
government during her pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;Although our fathers cannot be charged with having regarded
  the Devil in his respectful and deferential light, it must be acknowledged,
  that they gave him a conspicuous and distinguished&mdash;we might almost say
  a dignified&mdash;agency in the affairs of life and the government of the world:
  they were prone to confess, if not to revere, his presence, in all scenes and
  at all times. He occupied a wide space, not merely in their theology and philosophy,

  (Connecticut Magazine, November, 1899), HOADLEY.</font></p>
<br />

<p>Witchcraft in the Connecticut towns reached its climax in 1692&mdash;the
fateful year at Salem, Massachusetts&mdash;and the chief center of its
activity was in the border settlements at Fairfield. There, several
women early in the year were accused of the crime, and among them Mercy
Disborough. The testimonies against her were unique, and yet so typical
that they are given in part as the second illustration.</p>
<br />

<p>MERCY (DISBRO) DISBOROUGH</p>

<p>A special court, presided over by Robert Treat, Governor, was held at
Fairfield by order of the General Court, to try the witch cases, and
September 14, 1692, a true bill <a name="pg063"></a>was exhibited against Mercy Disborough,
wife of Thomas Disborough of Compo in Fairfield, in these words:</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy Disborough is complayned of &amp; accused as guilty of witchcraft for
that on the 25t of Aprill 1692 &amp; in the 4th year of their Maties reigne
&amp; at sundry other times she hath by the instigation &amp; help of the diuill
in a preternaturall way afflicted &amp; don harme to the bodyes &amp; estates of
sundry of their Maties subjects or to some of them contrary to the law
of God, the peace of our soueraigne lord &amp; lady the King &amp; Queen their
crowne &amp; dignity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;BILLA VERA.&quot;</p>
<br />

<p>Others were indicted and tried, at this session of the court and its
adjournments, notably Elizabeth Clawson. Many depositions were taken in
Fairfield and elsewhere, some of the defendants were discharged and
others convicted, but Mercy Disborough's case was the most noted one in
the tests applied, and in the conclusions to which it led. The whole
case with its singular incidents is worthy of careful study. Some of the
testimony is given here.</p>

roasting that looked verry well, but when it came to ye table (where we
had a very good lite) it seemed to me to have no skin upon it &amp; <a name="pg064"></a>looked
very strangly, but when ye sd Disburrow began to cut it ye skin (to my
apprehension) came againe upon it, &amp; it seemed to be as it was when upon
ye spit, at which strange alteration of ye pig I was much concerned
however fearing to displease his wife by refusing to eat, I did eat some
of ye pig, &amp; at ye same time Isaac Sherwood being there &amp; Disburrows

being of ye same mind that Sherwood was concerning yt place of scripture

of very large print) to me to read ye particular scripture, but tho I
had a good light &amp; looked ernestly upon ye book I could not see one
letter but looking upon it againe when in her hand after she had turned
over a few leaves I could see to read it above a yard of. Ye same night
going home &amp; coming to Compoh it seemed to be high water whereupon I
went to a cannoe that was about ten rods of (which lay upon such a bank
as ordinarily I could have shoved it into ye creek with ease) &amp; though I
lifted with all my might &amp; lifted one end very high from ye ground I
could by no means push it into ye creek &amp; then ye water seemed to be so

<br />

<p>&quot;It has been heretofore noted that during her trial&mdash;from the records of
which the foregoing testimony has been <a name="pg072"></a>taken&mdash;the prisoner Mercy
Disborough was subjected to a search for witch marks by a committee of
women, faithfully sworn narrowly and truly to inspect and search. This
indignity was repeated, and the women agreed &quot;that there is found on her
boddy as before they found, and nothing else.&quot; But the accused in order
to her further detection was subjected to another test of English
parentage, recommended by the authorities and embodied in the criminal
codes. It was the notorious water test, or ordeal by water. September
15, 1692, this test was made, chiefly on the testimony of a young girl
subject to epileptic fits and hysterics, who was carried into the
meetinghouse where the examination was being held. Thus runs the record:</p>

<a name="pg073"></a><p>Mercy Disborough, and another woman on trial at the same time
(Elizabeth Clauson), were put to the test together, and two eyewitnesses
of the sorry exhibition of cruelty and delusion made oath that they saw
Mercy and Elizabeth bound hand and foot and put into the water, and that
they swam upon the water like a cork, and when one labored to press them
into the water they buoyed up like cork.<a name="fnanchorG7"></a><a href="#footnoteG7">[G]</a></p>

15, 1692.</p>
<br />

<p>At the close of the trial the jury disagreed and the prisoner was
committed &quot;to the common goale there to be kept in safe custody till a
return may be made to the General Court for further direction what shall
be don in this matter;&quot; and the gentlemen of the jury were also to be
ready, when further called by direction of the General Court, to perfect
their verdict. The General Court ordered the Special Court to meet again
&quot;to put an issue to those former matters.&quot;</p>

<p>October 28, 1692, this entry appears of record:</p>

<p>&quot;The jury being called to make a return of their indictment that had
been committed to them concerning Mercy Disborough, they return that
they find the prisoner guilty according to the indictment of familiarity
with Satan. The jury being sent forth upon a second consideration of
their verdict returned that they saw no reason to alter their verdict,
but to find her guilty as before. The court approved of their verdict
and the Governor passed sentence of death upon her.&quot;</p>

<p>The hesitation of the jury to agree upon a verdict, the reference to the
General Court for more specific authority <a name="pg074"></a>to act, all point to serious
question of the evidence, the motives of witnesses, the value of the
traditional and lawful tests of the guilt of the accused.</p>

<p>In the search for facts which the old records certify to at this late
day, one is deeply impressed by the wisdom and potency of the sober
afterthought and conclusions of some of the clergy, lawyers, and men of
affairs, who sat as judges and jurors in the witch trials, which led
them to weigh and analyze the evidence, spectral and otherwise, and so
call a halt in the prosecutions and convictions.</p>

<p>What some of the Massachusetts men did and said in the contemporaneous
outbreak at Salem has been shown, but nowhere is the reaction there more
clearly illustrated than in the statement of Reverend John
Hale&mdash;great-grandsire of Nathan Hale, the revolutionary hero&mdash;the long
time pastor at Beverly Farms, who from personal experience became
convinced of the grave errors at the Salem trials, and in his <i>Modest
Inquiry</i> in 1697 said:</p>

<p>&quot;Such was the darkness of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the
afflicted, and the power of former precedents, that we walked in the
clouds and could not see our way.... observing the events of that sad
catastrophe,&mdash;Anno 1692,&mdash;I was brought to a more strict scanning of the
principles I had imbibed, and by scanning to question, and by
questioning at length to reject many of them.&quot; <i>Nathan Hale</i> (p. 10),
Johnston.</p>

<p>But no utterance takes higher rank, or deserves more consideration in
its appeal to sanity, justice, and humanity, than the declaration of
certain ministers and laymen of <a name="pg075"></a>Connecticut, in giving their advice and
&quot;reasons&quot; for a cessation of the prosecutions for witchcraft in the
colonial courts, and for reprieving Mercy Disborough under sentence of
death. This is the remarkable document:</p>

<p>&quot;Filed: The ministers aduice about the witches in Fayrfield, 1692.</p>

<p>&quot;As to ye evidences left to our consideration respecting ye two women
suspected of witchcraft at Fairfield we offer</p>

<p>&quot;1. That we cannot but give our concurrance with ye generallity of
divines that ye endeavour of conviction of witchcraft by swimming is
unlawful and sinfull &amp; therefore it cannot afford any evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;2. That ye unusuall excresencies found upon their bodies ought not to
be allowed as evidence against them without ye approbation of some able
physitians.</p>

<p>&quot;3. Respecting ye evidence of ye afflicted maid we find some things
testifyed carrying a suspition of her counterfeiting; Others that
plainly intimate her trouble from ye mother which improved by craft may
produce ye most of those strange &amp; unusuall effects affirmed of her; &amp;
of those things that by some may be thought to be diabolical or effects
of witchcraft. We apprehend her applying of them to these persons merely
from ye appearance of their spectres to her to be very uncertain and
failable from ye easy deception of her senses &amp; subtile devices of ye
devill, wherefore cannot think her a sufficient witnesse; yet we think
that her affliction being something strange it well deserves a farther
inquiry.</p>

<p>&quot;4. As to ye other strange accidents as ye dying of cattle &amp;c., we
apprehend ye applying of them to these <a name="pg076"></a>women as matters of witchcraft
to be upon very slender &amp; uncertain grounds.</p>

&quot;Filed: Reasons of Repreuing Mercy Desbrough.</p>

<p>&quot;To the Honrd Gen: Assembly of Connecticut Colony sitting in Hartford.
Reasons of repreuing Mercy Disbrough from being put to death until this
Court had cognizance of her case.</p>

<p>&quot;First, because wee that repreued her had power by the law so to do.
Secondly, because we had and haue sattisfying reasons that the sentence
of death passed against her ought not to be executed which reasons we
give to this Court to be judge of</p>

<p>&quot;1st. The jury that brought her in guilty (which uerdict was the ground
of her condemnation) was not the same jury who were first charged with
this prisoners deliuerance and who had it in charg many weeks. Mr.
Knowles was on the jury first sworn to try this woman and he was at or
about York when the Court sate the second time and when the uerdict was
given, the jury was altered and another man sworn.</p>

<p>&quot;It is so inuiolable a practice in law that the indiudual jurors and
jury that is charged with the deliuerance of a prisoner in a capital
case and on whom the prisoner puts himself or herself to be tryed must
try it and they only that al the presidents in Old England and New
confirm 9<a name="pg077"></a>it and not euer heard of til this time to be inouated. And yet
not only president but the nature of the thing inforces it for to these
juors the law gaue this power vested it in them they had it in right of
law and it is incompatible and impossible that it should be uested in
these and in others too for then two juries may haue the same power in
the same case one man altered the jury is altered.</p>

<p>&quot;Tis the birthright of the Kings' subjects so and no otherwise to be
tryed and they must not be despoyled of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Due form of law is that alone wherein the ualidity of verdicts and
judgments in such cases stands and if a real and apparent murtherer be
condemned and executed out of due form of law it is inditable against
them that do it for in such case the law is superseded by arbitrary
doings.</p>

<p>&quot;What the Court accepts and the prisoner accepts differing from the law
is nothing what the law admitts is al in the case.</p>

<p>&quot;If one jury may be changed two, ten, the whole may be so, and solemn
oathe made uain.</p>

<p>&quot;Wee durst not but dissent from and declare against such alterations by
our repreueing therefore the said prisoner when ye were informed of this
business about her jury, and we pray this honored Court to take heed
what they do in it now it is roled to their doore and that at least they
be well sattisfied from able lawyers that such a chang is in law
alowable ere this prisoner be executed least they bring themselues into
inextricable troubles and the whole country. Blood is a great thing and
we cannot but open our mouths for the dumb in the cause of one appointed
to die by such a uerdict.</p>

<p>&quot;2dly. We had a good accompt of the euidences giuen <a name="pg078"></a>against her that
none of them amounted to what Mr. Perkins, Mr. Bernard and Mr. Mather
with others state as sufficiently conuictiue of witchcraft, namely 1st
Confession (this there was none of) 2dly two good wittnesses proueing
som act or acts done by the person which could not be but by help of the
deuill, this is the summe of what they center in as thair books show as
for the common things of spectral euidence il euents after quarels or
threates, teates, water tryalls and the like with suspitious words they
are al discarded and som of them abominated by the most judicious as to
be conuictiue of witchcraft and the miserable toyl they are in the Bay
for adhereing to these last mentioned litigious things is warning enof,
those that will make witchcraft of such things will make hanging work
apace and we are informed of no other but such as these brought against
this woman.</p>

<p>&quot;These in brief are our reasons for repreueing this prisoner.

this woman.&quot;</p>

associates; to Samuel Willis, Pitkin and Nath. Stanly, level-headed men
of affairs, all friends of the court called upon for advice and
counsel&mdash;who gave it in full scriptural measure.<a name="fnanchorH8"></a><a href="#footnoteH8">[H]</a></p>

<a name="chap8"></a><h2><a name="pg079"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;Old Matthew Maule was executed for the crime of witchcraft.
  He was one of the martyrs to that terrible delusion, which should teach us,
  among its other morals, that the influential classes, and those who take upon
  themselves to be leaders of the people, are fully liable to all the passionate
  error that has ever characterized the maddest mob.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;Clergymen, judges, statesmen&mdash;the wisest, calmest,
  holiest persons of their day&mdash;stood in the inner circle round about the
  gallows, loudest to applaud the work of blood, latest to confess themselves
  miserably deceived.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;This old reprobate was one of the sufferers when Cotton
  Mather, and his brother ministers, and the learned judges, and other wise men,
  and Sir William Phipps, the sagacious governor, made such
  laudable efforts to weaken the great enemy of souls by sending a multitude of
  his adherents up the rocky pathway of Gallows Hill.&quot; <i>The House of the
  Seven Gables</i> (20: 225), HAWTHORNE.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">&quot;Then, too, the belief in witchcraft was general. Striking
  coincidences, personal eccentricities, unusual events and mysterious diseases
  seemed to find an easy explanation in an unholy compact with the devil. A witticism
  attributed to Judge Sewall, one of the judges in these trials, may help us to
  understand the common panic: 'We know who's who but not which is witch.' That
  was the difficulty. At a time when every one believed in witchcraft it was easy
  to suspect one's neighbor. It was a characteristic superstition of the century
  and should be classed with the barbarous punishments and religious intolerance
  of the age.&quot; <i>N.E. Hist. Towns</i>.&mdash;LATIMER'S&mdash;<i>Salem</i>
  (150).</font></p>
<br />

<p>Multiplication of these witchcraft testimonies, quaint and curious,
vulgar and commonplace, evil and pathetic, voices all of a strange
superstition, understandable only as through them alone can one gain a
clear <a name="pg080"></a>perspective of the spirit of the time and place, would prove
wearisome. They may well remain in the ancient records until they find
publicity in detail in some accurate and complete history of the
beginnings of the commonwealth&mdash;including this strange chapter in its
unique history.</p>

<p>It will, however, serve a present necessary purpose, and lead to a more
exact conception of the reign of unreason, if glimpses be taken here and
there of a few of the statements made on oath in some of the other
cases.</p>

<p>Daniell Gabbett and Margaret Garrett&mdash;<i>The mess of parsnips&mdash;Hains' &quot;hodg
podg&quot;&mdash;Satan's interference</i></p>

<p>&quot;The testimony of Daniell Garrett senior and the testimony of Margarett
Garrett. Goodwife Gaarrett saith that goodwife Seager said there was a
day kept at Mr. Willis in reference to An Coale; and she further said
she was in great trouble euen in agony of spirit, the ground as follows
that she sent her owne daughtr Eliza Seager to goodwife Hosmer to carry
her a mess a parsnips. Goodwife Hosmer was not home. She was at Mr.
Willis at the fast. Goodm Hosmer and his son was at home. Goodm Hosmer
bid the child carry the parsnips home againe he would not receiue them
and if her mother desired a reason, bid her send her father and he would
tell him the reason. Goodwife Seager upon the return of the parsnips
was much troubled and sent for her husband and sent him up to Goodm
Hosmer to know the reason why he would not reciue the parsnips, and he
told goodman Seager it was because An Coale at the fast at Mr. Willis
cryed out against his wife as being a witch and he would not receiue
<a name="pg081"></a>the parsnips least he should be brought in hereaftr as a testimony
against his wife. Then goodwif Seager sd that Mr. Hains had writt a
great deal of hodg podg that An Coale had sd that she was under
suspicion for a witch, and then she went to prayer, and did adventure to
bid Satan go and tell them she was no witch. This deponent after she had
a little paused said, who did you say, then goodw Seger sd againe she
had sent Satan to tell them she was no witch. This deponent asked her
why she made use of Satan to tell them, why she did not besech God to
tell them she was no witch. She answered because Satan knew she was no
witch. Goodman Garrett testifies that before him and his wife, Goodwife
Seager said that she sent Satan to tell them she was no witch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw this woman goodwife Seager in ye woods wth three more women and

likewise a kettle there over a fire. I saw the women dance round these
black creatures and whiles I looked upon them one of the women G:
Greensmith said looke who is yonder and then they ran away up the hill.
I stood still and ye black things came towards mee and then I turned to
come away. He further saith I knew the psons by their habits or clothes
haueing observed such clothes on them not long before.&quot;</p>

<a name="pg082"></a><p>&quot;Wee underwritten do testifie, that goodwife Seager said, (upon the
relateing of goodwife Garrett testimony, in reference to Seager sending
Satan,) that the reason why she sent Satan, was because he knew she was
no witch, we say Seager said Dame you can remember part of what I said,
but you do not speak of the whole you say nothing of what I brought to
prove that Satan knew that I was no witch. I brought that place in the

be a witch and desired her to be one, she should not ned fare going to

<p><i>Staggerings of the jury&mdash;&quot;Shuffing&quot;&mdash;&quot;Grinding teeth&quot;&mdash;Seager's
denials&mdash;Contradictions&mdash;Acquittal</i></p>

<p>&quot;Janur 16 1662</p>

<p>&quot;The causes why half the jury ore more did in their vote cast gooddy
Seger (and the rest of the jury were deeply suspitious, and were at a
great loss and staggeringe whereby they were sometimes likely to com up
in their judgments to the rest, whereby she was allmost gone and cast as
the foreman expressed to her at giuing in of the verdict) are these</p>

<p>&quot;First it did apeare by legall euidence that she had intimat
familliarity with such as had been wiches, viz goody Sanford and goody
Ayrs. 2ly this she did in open court stoutly denie saing the witnesses
were preiudiced persons, and that she had now more intimacy then they
themselves, and when the witneses questioned with her about frequent
<a name="pg084"></a>being there she said she went to lerne to knitt; this also she stoutly
denied, and said of the witneses they belie me, then when Mr. John Allen
sd did she not teach you to knitt, she answered sturdily and sayd, I do
not know that I am bound to tell you &amp; at another time being pressed to
answ she sayd, nay I will hould what I have if I must die, yet after
this she confessed that she had so much intimacy with one of ym as that
they did change woorke one with another. 3ly she having sd that she did
hate goody Aiers it did appear that she bore her great yea more than
ordinarily good will as apeared by releeuing her in her truble, and was
couert way, and was trubled that is was discouered; likewise when goody
Aiers said in court, this will take away my liffe, goody Seger shuffed
her with her hand &amp; sd hould your tongue wt grinding teeth Mr. John
Allen being one wittnes hearto when he had spoken, she sd they seek my
innocent blood; the magistrats replied, who she sd euery body. 4ly being
spoken to about triall by swiming, she sagd the diuill that caused me to
com heare can keep me up.</p>

<p>&quot;About the buisnes of fliing the most part thought it was not legally
proued.</p>

<p>&quot;Lastly the woman and Robert Stern being boath upon oath their wittnes
was judged legall testimony ore evidence only som in the jury because
Sternes first words upon his oath were, I saw these women and as I take
it goody Seger was there though after that he sayd, I saw her there, I
knew her well I know God will require her blood at my hands if I should
testifie falsly. Allso bec he sd he saw her kittle, there being at so
great a distance, they doubted that these things did not only weaken &amp;
blemish <a name="pg085"></a>his testimony, but also in a great measure disable it for
standing to take away liffe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;WALT. FYLER.&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth Seager was acquitted.</p>

<p>ELIZABETH GODMAN</p>

<p>Of all the women who set the communities ablaze with their witcheries,
none in fertility of invention and performance surpassed Elizabeth
Godman of New Haven&mdash;a member of the household of Stephen Goodyear, the
Deputy Governor. Reverend John Davenport said, in a sermon of the time,
&quot;that a froward discontented frame of spirit was a subject fitt for ye
Devill,&quot; and Elizabeth was accused by Goodwife Larremore and others of
being in &quot;such a frame of spirit,&quot; and of practicing the black arts.</p>

<p>She promptly haled her accusers before a court of magistrates, August 4,
1653, with Governor Theophilus Eaton and Deputy Governor Stephen
Goodyear present; and when asked what she charged them with, she desired
that &quot;a wrighting might be read&mdash;wch was taken in way of examination
before ye magistrate,&quot; in May, 1653. The &quot;wrighting&quot; did not prove
helpful to Elizabeth's case. The statements of witnesses and of the
accused are in some respects unique, and of a decided personal quality.</p>

Mr. Goodyeare, Mris. Goodyeare, Mr. Hooke, Mris. Hooke, Mris. Atwater,
Hanah &amp; Elizabeth Lamberton, goodwife Larremore, goodwife Thorpe, &amp;c.,
and was asked what she had to charge them wth, she said they had given
out speeches that made folkes thinke she was a witch, and first she
charged Mris. Atwater to be ye cause of all, and to cleere things
desired a wrighting might be read wch was taken in way of examination
before ye magistrate, (and in here after entred,) wherein sundrie things
concerning Mris. Atwater is specifyed wch we now more fully spoken to,
and she further said that Mris. Atwater had said that she thought she
was a witch and that Hobbamocke was her husband, but could proue
nothing, though she was told that she was beforehand warned to prepare
her witnesses ready, wch she hath not done, if she haue any. After
sundrie of the passages in ye wrighting were read, she was asked if
these things did not giue just ground of suspition to all that heard
them that she was a witch. She confessed they did, but said if she spake
such things as is in Mr. Hookes relation she was not herselfe.... Beside
what is in the papr, Mris. Godman was remembred of a passage spoken of
at the gouernors aboute Mr. Goodyeare's falling into a swonding fitt
after hee had spoken something one night in the exposition of a chapter,
wch she (being present) liked not but said it was against her, and as
soone as Mr. Goodyeare had done duties she flung out of the roome in a
discontented way and cast a fierce looke vpon Mr. Goodyeare as she went
out, and imediately Mr. Goodyeare (though well before) fell into a
swond, and beside her notorious lying in this buisnes, for being asked
how she <a name="pg087"></a>came to know this, she said she was present, yet Mr. Goodyeare,

in ye roome but gone vp into the chamber.&quot;</p>

<p>THE &quot;WRIGHTING&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The examination of Elizabeth Godman, May 12th, 1653.</p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth Godman made complainte of Mr. Goodyeare, Mris. Goodyeare, Mr.
Hooke, Mris. Hooke, Mris. Bishop, Mris. Atwater, Hanah &amp; Elizabeth
Lamberton, and Mary Miles, Mris. Atwaters maide, that they haue
suspected her for a witch; she was now asked what she had against Mr.
Hooke and Mris. Hooke; she said she heard they had something against her
aboute their soone. Mr. Hooke said hee was not wthout feares, and hee
had reasons for it; first he said it wrought suspition in his minde
because shee was shut out at Mr. Atwaters vpon suspition, and hee was
troubled in his sleepe aboute witches when his boye, was sicke, wch was
in a verey strang manner, and hee looked vpon her as a mallitious one,
and prepared to that mischiefe, and she would be often speaking aboute
witches and rather justifye them then condemne them; she said why doe
they provoake them, why doe they not let them come into the church.
Another time she was speaking of witches wthout any occasion giuen her,
and said if they accused her for a witch she would haue them to the
gouernor, she would trounce them. Another time she was saying she had
some thoughts, what if the Devill should come to sucke her, and she
resolued he should not <a name="pg088"></a>sucke her.... Time, Mr. Hookes Indian, said in
church meeting time she would goe out and come in againe and tell them
what was done at meeting. Time asking her who told, she answered plainly
she would not tell, then Time said did not ye Devill tell you.... Time
said she heard her one time talking to herselfe, and she said to her,
who talke you too, she said, to you; Time said you talke to ye Devill,
but she made nothing of it. Mr. Hooke further said, that he hath heard
that they that are adicted that way would hardly be kept away from ye
houses where they doe mischiefe, and so it was wth her when his boy was
sicke, she would not be kept away from him, nor gott away when she was
there, and one time Mris. Hooke bid her goe away, and thrust her from ye
boye, but she turned againe and said she would looke on him. Mris.
Goodyeare said that one time she questioned wth Elizabeth Godmand aboute
ye boyes sickness, and said what thinke you of him, is he not strangly
handled, she replyed, what, doe you thinke hee is bewitched; Mris.
Goodyeare said nay I will keepe my thoughts to myselfe, but in time God
will discouer ...</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Hooke further said, that when Mr. Bishop was married, Mris. Godman
came to his house much troubled, so as he thought it might be from some
affection to him, and he asked her, she said yes; now it is suspitious
that so soone as they were contracted Mris. Byshop fell into verey
strang fitts wch hath continewed at times euer since, and much suspition
there is that she hath bine the cause of the loss of Mris. Byshops
chilldren, for she could tell when Mris. Bishop was to be brought to
bedd, and hath giuen out that she kills her chilldren wth longing,
because <a name="pg089"></a>she longs for every thing she sees, wch Mris. Bishop denies....
Another thing suspitious is, that she could tell Mris. Atwater had figgs
in her pocket when she saw none of them; to that she answered she smelt
them, and could smell figgs if she came in the roome, nere them that had
them; yet at this time Mris. Atwater had figgs in her pocket and came
neere her, yet she smelt them not; also Mris. Atwater said that Mris.
Godman could tell that they one time had pease porridge, when they could
none of them tell how she came to know, and beeing asked she saith she
see ym on the table, and another time she saith she was there in ye
morning when the maide set them on. Further Mris. Atwater saith, that
that night the figgs was spoken of they had strangers to supper, and
Mris. Godman was at their house, she cutt a sopp and put in pann; Betty
Brewster called the maide to tell her &amp; said she was aboute her workes
of darkness, and was suspitious of Mris. Godman, and spake to her of it,
and that night Betty Brewster was in a most misserable case, heareing a
most dreadfull noise wch put her in great feare and trembling, wch put
her into such a sweate as she was all on a water when Mary Miles came to
goe to bed, who had fallen into a sleepe by the fire wch vsed not to
doe, and in ye morning she looked as one yt had bine allmost dead....</p>

<p>&quot;Mris. Godman accused Mr. Goodyeare for calling her downe when Mris.
Bishop was in a sore fitt, to looke vpon her, and said he doubted all
was not well wth her, and that hee feared she was a witch, but Mr.
Goodyeare denyed that; vpon this Mris. Godman was exceeding angrie and
would haue the servants called to witnes, and bid <a name="pg090"></a>George the Scochman
goe aske his master who bewitched her for she was not well, and vpon
this presently Hanah Lamberton (being in ye roome) fell into a verey
sore fitt in a verey strang maner....</p>

<p>&quot;Another time Mris. Goodyeare said to her, Mris. Elzebeth what thinke
you of my daughters case; she replyed what, doe you thinke I haue
bewitched her; Mris. Goodyeare said if you be the ptie looke to it, for
they intend to haue such as is suspected before the magistrate.</p>

<p>&quot;Mris. Godman charged Hanah Lamberton that she said she lay for somewhat
to sucke her, when she came in hott one day and put of some cloathes and
lay vpon the bed in her chamber. Hanah said she and her sister Elizabeth
went vp into the garet aboue her roome, and looked downe &amp; said, looke
how she lies, she lyes as if som bodey was sucking her, &amp; vpon that she
arose and said, yes, yes, so there is; after said Hanah, she hath
something there, for so there seemed as if something was vnder the
cloathes; Elizabeth said what haue you there, she said nothing but the
cloathes, and both Hanah &amp; Eliza. say that Mris. Godman threatened
Hanah, and said let her looke to it for God will bring it vpon her owne
head, and about two dayes after, Hanahs fitts began, and one night
especially had a dreadfull fitt, and was pinched, and heard a hedious
noise, and was in a strang manner sweating and burning, and some time
cold and full of paine yt she shriked out.</p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth Lamberton saith that one time ye chilldren came downe &amp; said
Mris. Godman was talking to herselfe and they were afraide, then she
went vp softly and heard her talke, what, will you fetch me some beare,
will you goe, will you goe, and ye like, and one morning aboute <a name="pg091"></a>breake
of day Henry Boutele said he heard her talke to herselfe, as if some
body had laine wth her....</p>

<p>&quot;Mris. Goodyeare said when Mr. Atwaters kinswoman was married Mris.
Bishop was there, and the roome being hott she was something fainte,
vpon that Mris. Godman said she would haue many of these fainting fitts
after she was married, but she saith she remembers it not....</p>

<p>&quot;Goodwife Thorp complained that Mris. Godman came to her house and asked
to buy some chickens, she said she had none to sell, Mris. Godman said
will you giue them all, so she went away, and she thought then that if
this woman was naught as folkes suspect, may be she will smite my
chickens, and quickly after one chicken dyed, and she remembred she had
heard if they were bewitched they would consume wthin, and she opened it
and it was consumed in ye gisard to water &amp; wormes, and divers others of
them droped, and now they are missing and it is likely dead, and she
neuer saw either hen or chicken that was so consumed wthin wth wormes.
Mris. Godman said goodwife Tichenor had a whole brood so, and Mris.
Hooke had some so, but for Mris. Hookes it was contradicted presently.
This goodwife Thorp thought good to declare that it may be considered
wth other things.&quot;</p>

<p>The court decided that Elizabeth's carriage and confession rendered her
&quot;suspitious&quot; of witchcraft, and admonished her that &quot;if further proofe
come these passages will not be forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p>The further proof came forth promptly, since in August, 1655, Elizabeth
was again called before the court for witchcraft, and the witnesses
certified to &quot;the doing of strange things.&quot;</p>

<p><i><a name="pg092"></a>The Governor's quandary&mdash;Elizabeth's &quot;spirituall armour&quot;&mdash;&quot;The
jumbling at the chamber dore&quot;&mdash;The lost grapes&mdash;The tethered
calfe&mdash;&quot;Hott beare&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;At a court held at Newhaven the 7th of August 1655.</p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth Godman was again called before the Court, and told that she
lies under suspition for witchcraft, as she knowes, the grounds of which
were examined in a former court, and by herselfe confessed to be just
grounds of suspition, wch passages were now read, and to these some more
are since added, wch are now to be declared.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Goodyeare said that the last winter, upon occasion of Gods
afflicting hand upon the plantation by sickness, the private meeting
whereof he is had appointed to set a day apart to seeke God: Elizabeth
Godman desired she might be there; he told her she was under suspition,
and it would be offensive; she said she had great need of it, for she
was exercised wth many temptations, and saw strange appearitions, and
lights aboute her bed, and strange sights wch affrighted her; some of
his family said if she was affraide they would worke wth her in the day
and lye with her in the night, but she refused and was angry and said
she would haue none to be wth her for she had her spirituall armour
aboute her. She was asked the reason of this; she answered, she said so
to Mr. Goodyeare, but it was her fancy troubled her, and she would haue
none lye wth her because her bed was weake; she was told that might haue
been mended; then she said she was not willing to haue any of them wth
her, for if any thing had fallen ill wth them they would haue said that
she had bine the cause.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="pg093"></a>Mr. Goodyeare further declared that aboute three weekes agoe he had a
verey great disturbance in his family in the night (Eliza: Godman hauing
bine the day before much discontented because Mr. Goodyeare warned her
to provide another place to live in) his daughter Sellevant, Hanah
Goodyeare, and Desire Lamberton lying together in the chamber under
Eliza: Godman; after they were in bed they heard her walke up and downe
and talk aloude; but could not tell what she said; then they heard her
go downe the staires and come up againe; they fell asleep, but were
after awakened wth a great jumbling at the chamber dore, and something
came into the chamber wch jumbled at the other end of the roome and
aboute the trunke and amonge the shooes and at the beds head; it came
nearer the bed and Hanah was affraid and called father, but he heard
not, wch made her more affraide; then cloathes were pulled of their bed
by something, two or three times; they held and something pulled, wch
frighted them so that Hanah Goodyeare called her father so loude as was
thought might be heard to the meetinghouse, but the noise was heard to
Mr. Samuell Eatons by them that watched wth her; so after a while Mr.
Goodyeare came and found them in a great fright; they lighted a candell
and he went to Eliza: Godmans chamber and asked her why she disturbed
the family; she said no, she was scared also and thought the house had
bine on fire, yet the next day she said in the family that she knew
nothing till Mr. Goodyeare came up, wch she said is true she heard the
noise but knew not the cause till Mr. Goodyeare came; and being asked
why she went downe staires after she was gon up to bed, she said to
light a candell to<a name="pg094"></a> looke for two grapes she had lost in the flore and
feared the mice would play wth them in the night and disturbe ye family,
wch reason in the Courts apprehension renders her more suspitious.</p>

<p>Allen Ball informed the Court. Another time she came into his yard; his
wife asked what she came for; she said to see her calfe; now they had a
sucking calfe, wch they tyed in the lott to a great post that lay on ye
ground, and the calfe ran away wth that post as if it had bine a fether
and ran amonge Indian corne and pulled up two hills and stood still;
after he tyed the calfe to a long heauy raile, as much as he could well
lift, and one time she came into ye yard and looked on ye calfe and it
set a running and drew the raile after it till it came to a fence and
gaue a great cry in a lowing way and stood still; and in ye winter the
calfe dyed, doe what he could, yet eate its meale well enough.</p>

<p>Some other passages were spoken of aboute Mris. Yale, that one time
there being some words betwixt them, wth wch Eliza: Godman was
unsatisfyed, the night following Mris. Yales things were throwne aboute
the house in a strange manner; and one time being at Goodman Thorpes,
aboute weauing some cloth, in wch something discontented her, and that
night they had a great noise in the house, wch much affrighted them, but
they know not what it was.</p>

<p>These things being declared the Court told Elizabeth Godman that they
haue considered them, wth her former miscarriages, and see cause to
order that she be comitted to prison, ther to abide the Courts pleasure,
but because the matter is of weight, and the crime whereof she is
<a name="pg095"></a>suspected capitall, therefore she is to answer it at the Court of
Magistrates in October next.&quot;</p>

<p>In October, 1655, Elizabeth &quot;was again called before the court and told
that upon grounds formerly declared wch stand upon record, she by her
owne confession remains under suspition for witchcraft, and one more is
now added, and that is, that one time this last summer, comeing to Mr.
Hookes to beg some beare, was at first denyed, but after, she was
offered some by his daughter which stood ready drawne, wch she had, yet
went away in a muttering discontented manner, and after this, that
night, though the beare was good and fresh, yet the next morning was
hott, soure and ill tasted, yea so hott as the barrell was warme wthout
side, and when they opened the bung it steemed forth; they brewed againe
and it was so also, and so continewed foure or fiue times, one after
another.</p>

<p>&quot;She brought diuers psons to the court that they might say something to
cleere her, and much time was spent in hearing ym, but to little
purpose, the grounds of suspition remaining full as strong as before and
she found full of lying, wherfore the court declared vnto her that
though the euidenc is not sufficient as yet to take away her life, yet
the suspitions are cleere and many, wch she cannot by all the meanes she
hath vsed, free herselfe from, therfore she must forbeare from goeing
from house to house to give offenc, and cary it orderly in the family
where she is, wch if she doe not, she will cause the court to comitt her
to prison againe, &amp; that she doe now presently vpon her freedom giue
securitie for her good behauiour; and she did now before the court
ingage fifty pound of her estate <a name="pg096"></a>that is in Mr. Goodyeers hand, for her
good behauior, wch is further to be cleered next court, when Mr.
Goodyeare is at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was suffered to dwell in the family of Thomas Johnson, where she
continued till her death, October 9th, 1660.&quot; (<i>New Haven Town Records</i>,
Vol. ii, pp. 174,179.)</p>
<br />

<p>NATHANIEL AND REBECCA GREENSMITH</p>

<p>Nathaniel Greensmith lived in Hartford, south of the little river, in
1661-62, on a lot of about twenty acres, with a house and barn. He also
had other holdings &quot;neer Podunk,&quot; and &quot;on ye highway leading to
Farmington.&quot;</p>

<p>He was thrifty by divergent and economical methods, since he is credited
in the records of the time with stealing a bushel and a half of wheat,
of stealing a hoe, and of lying to the court, and of battery.</p>

<p>In one way or another he accumulated quite a property for those days,
since the inventory of it filed in the Hartford Probate Office, January
25, 1662, after his execution, carried an appraisal of &pound;137. l4s.
1<i>d</i>.&mdash;including &quot;2 bibles,&quot; &quot;a sword,&quot; &quot;a resthead,&quot; and a &quot;drachm
cup&quot;&mdash;all indicating that Nathaniel judiciously mingled his theology and
patriotism, his recreation and refreshment, with his everyday practical
affairs and opportunities.</p>

<p>But he made one adventure that was most unprofitable. In an evil hour he
took to wife Rebecca, relict of Abraham Elson, and also relict of Jarvis
Mudge, and of whom so good a man as the Rev. John Whiting, minister of
the First Church in Hartford&mdash;afterward first pastor of the Second
Church&mdash;said that she was &quot;a lewd, ignorant and considerably aged
woman.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="pg097"></a>This triple combination of personal qualities soon elicited the
criticism and animosity of the community, and Nathaniel and Rebecca fell
under the most fatal of all suspicions of that day, that of being
possessed by the evil one.</p>

<p>Gossip and rumor about these unpopular neighbors culminated in a formal
complaint, and December 30, 1662, at a court held at Hartford, both the
Greensmiths were separately indicted in the same formal charge.</p>

<p>&quot;Nathaniel Greensmith thou art here indicted by the name of Nathaniel
Greensmith for not having the fear of God before thine eyes, thou hast
entertained familiarity with Satan, the grand enemy of God and
mankind&mdash;and by his help hast acted things in a preternatural way beyond
human abilities in a natural course for which according to the law of
God and the established law of this commonwealth thou deservest to die.&quot;</p>

<p>While Rebecca was in prison under suspicion, she was interviewed by two
ministers, Revs. Haynes and Whiting, as to the charges of Ann Cole&mdash;a
next door neighbor&mdash;which were written down by them, all of which, and
more, she confessed to be true before the court.</p>

<p>(Note. Increase Mather regarded this confession as convictive a proof of
real witchcraft as most single cases he had known.)</p>

<p>THE MINISTERS' ACCOUNT&mdash;<i>Promise to Satan&mdash;A merry Christmas
meeting&mdash;Stone's lecture&mdash;Haynes' plea&mdash;The dear Devil&mdash;The corvine
guest&mdash;Sexual delusions</i></p>

<p>&quot;She forthwith and freely confessed those things to be true, that she
(and other persons named in the discourse) had familiarity with the
devil. Being asked whether she <a name="pg098"></a>had made an express covenant with him,
she answered she had not, only as she promised to go with him when he
called (which she had accordingly done several times). But that the
devil told her that at Christmas they would have a merry meeting, and
then the covenant should be drawn and subscribed. Thereupon the
fore-mentioned Mr. Stone (being then in court) with much weight and
earnestness laid forth the exceeding heinousness and hazard of that
dreadful sin; and therewith solemnly took notice (upon the occasion
given) of the devil's loving Christmas.</p>

<p>&quot;A person at the same time present being desired the next day more
particularly to enquire of her about her guilt, it was accordingly done,
to whom she acknowledged that though when Mr. Haynes began to read she
could have torn him in pieces, and was so much resolved as might be to
deny her guilt (as she had done before) yet after he had read awhile,
she was as if her flesh had been pulled from her bones, (such was her
expression,) and so could not deny any longer. She also declared that
the devil first appeared to her in the form of a deer or fawn, skipping
about her, wherewith she was not much affrighted but by degrees he
contrived talk with her; and that their meetings were frequently at such
a place, (near her own house;) that some of the company came in one
shape and some in another, and one in particular in the shape of a crow
came flying to them. Amongst other things she owned that the devil had
frequent use of her body.&quot;</p>

<p>Had Rebecca been content with purging her own conscience, she alone
would have met the fate she had invoked, and probably deserved; but out
of &quot;love to her <a name="pg099"></a>husband's soul&quot; she made an accusation against him,
which of itself secured his conviction of the same offense, with the
same dire penalty.</p>

<p>THE ACCUSATION&mdash;<i>Nathaniel's plea&mdash;&quot;Travaile and labour&quot;&mdash;&quot;A red
creature&quot;--- Prenuptial doubts&mdash;The weighty logs&mdash;Wifely tenderness and
anxiety&mdash;Under the greenwood tree&mdash;A cat call&mdash;Terpsichore and Bacchus</i></p>

<p>&quot;Rebecca Greenswith testifieth in Court Janry 8. 62.</p>

<p>&quot;1. That my husband on Friday night last when I came to prison told me
that now thou hast confest against thyself let me alone and say nothing
of me and I wilbe good unto thy children.</p>

<p>&quot;I doe now testifie that formerly when my husband hathe told me of his
great travaile and labour I wondered at it how he did it this he did
before I was married and when I was married I asked him how he did it
and he answered me he had help yt I knew not of.</p>

<p>&quot;3. About three years agoe as I think it; my husband and I were in ye
wood several miles from home and were looking for a sow yt we lost and I
saw a creature a red creature following my husband and when I came to
him I asked him what it was that was with him and he told me it was a
fox.</p>

<p>&quot;4. Another time when he and I drove or hogs into ye woods beyond ye
pound yt was to keep yong cattle severall miles of I went before ye hogs
to call them and looking back I saw two creatures like dogs one a little
blacker then ye other, they came after my husband pretty close to him
and one did seem to me to touch him I asked him wt they were he told me
he thought foxes I was stil afraid <a name="pg100"></a>when I saw anything because I heard
soe much of him before I married him.</p>

<p>&quot;5. I have seen logs that my husband hath brought home in his cart that
I wondered at it that he could get them into ye cart being a man of
little body and weake to my apprhension and ye logs were such that I
thought two men such as he could not have done it.</p>

<p>&quot;I speak all this out of love to my husbands soule and it is much
against my will that I am now necessitate to speake agaynst my husband,
I desire that ye Lord would open his heart to owne and speak ye trueth.</p>

<p>&quot;I also testify that I being in ye wood at a meeting there was wth me
Goody Seager Goodwife Sanford &amp; Goodwife Ayres; and at another time
there was a meeting under a tree in ye green by or house &amp; there was
there James Walkely, Peter Grants wife Goodwife Aires &amp; Henry Palmers
wife of Wethersfield, &amp; Goody Seager, &amp; there we danced, &amp; had a bottle
of sack: it was in ye night &amp; something like a catt cald me out to ye
meeting &amp; I was in Mr. Varlets orcherd wth Mrs. Judeth Varlett &amp; shee
tould me that shee was much troubled wth ye Marshall Jonath: Gilbert &amp;
cried, &amp; she sayd if it lay in her power she would doe him a mischief,
or what hurt shee could.&quot;</p>

<p>The Greensmiths were convicted and sentenced to suffer death. In
January, 1662, they were hung on &quot;Gallows Hill,&quot; on the bluff a little
north of where Trinity College now stands&mdash;&quot;a logical location&quot; one most
learned in the traditions and history of Hartford calls it&mdash;as it
afforded an excellent view of the execution to a large crowd on the
meadows to the west, a hanging being then a popular spectacle and
entertainment.</p>

taken with strang fits she was sent for to Danil Wescots house &amp; she
found ye garle lieing upon ye bed. She then did apprehend yt the garls
illness might be from sum naturall cause; she therefore aduised them to
burn feathers under her nose &amp; other menes yt had dun good in fainting
fits and then she seemed to be better with it; and so she left her that
night in hops to here she wold <a name="pg105"></a>be better ye next morning; but in ye
morning Danil Wescot came for her againe and when she came she found ye
garl in bed seemingly senceless &amp; spechless; her eyes half shet but her
pulse seemed to beat after ye ordinary maner her mistres desired she
might be let blud on ye foot in hops it might do her good. Then I said I
thought it could not be dun in ye capassity she was in but she desired a
triall to be made and when euerything was redy &amp; we were agoing to let
her blud ye garl cried; the reson was asked her why she cried; her
answer was she would not be bluded; we asked her why; she said again
because it would hurt her it was said ye hurt would be but small like a
prick of a pin then she put her foot ouer ye bed and was redy to help
about it; this cariag of her seemed to me strang who before seemed to ly
like a dead creature; after she was bluded and had laid a short time she
clapt her hand upon ye couerlid &amp; cried out; and on of ye garls yt stood
by said mother she cried out; and her mistres was so afected with it yt
she cried and said she is bewitched. Upon this ye garl turned her head
from ye folk as if she wold hide it in ye pillar &amp; laughed.&quot; The above

sd Kate continued all the night, &amp; neuer came to her sences but had som

came over from Gardiner's Island and settled in the colony, Joshua
Garlick and Elizabeth his wife&mdash;whilom servants of the famous engineer
and colonist Lion Gardiner.</p>

<p>Stories of Elizabeth's practice of witchcraft and other black arts
followed her, and despite her attendance at church she fell under
suspicion, and was arrested, and held by the magistrates for trial after
hearing various witnesses. Credulity offers no better illustrations than
those which fell from the lips of some of the witnesses in this case.</p>

<p><i>Tuning a psalm&mdash;A black thing&mdash;A double tongued woman&mdash;A doleful
noise&mdash;Burning the herbs&mdash;The sick child&mdash;Gardiner's ox&mdash;The dead
ram&mdash;Burning &quot;the sow's tale&quot;</i></p>

<p>Goodwife Howell, during her illness which hastened <a name="pg120"></a>Elizabeth's arrest,
&quot;tuned a psalm and screked out several times together very grievously,&quot;
and cried &quot;a witch! a witch! now are you come to torter me because I
spoke two or three words against you,&quot; and also said, she saw a black
thing at the beds featte, that Garlick was double-tongued, pinched her
with pins, and stood by the bed ready to tear her in pieces. And William
Russell, in a fit of insomnia or indigestion, before daybreak, &quot;heard a
very doleful noyse on ye backside of ye fire, like ye noyse of a great
stone thrown down among a heap of stones.&quot;</p>

<p>Goody Birdsall &quot;declared y't she was in the house of Goody Simons when
Goody Bishop came into the house with ye dockweed and between Goody
Davis and Goody Simons they burned the herbs. Farther, she said y't
formerly dressing flax at Goody Davis's house, Goody D>avis saith y't she
had dressed her children in clean linen at the island, and Goody Garlick
came in and said, 'How pretty the child doth look,' and so soon as she
had spoken Goody Garlick said, 'the child is not well, for it groaneth,'
and Goody Davis said her heart did rise, and Goody Davis said, when she
took the child from Goody Garlick, she said she saw death in the face of
it, &amp; her child sickened presently upon it, and lay five daies and 5
nights and never opened the eyes nor dried till it died. Also she saith
as she dothe remember Goody Davis told her upon some difference between
Mr. Gardiner or some of his family, Goodman Garlick gave out some
threateningse speeches, &amp; suddenly after Mr. Gardiner had an ox legge
broke upon Ram Island. Moreover Goody Davis said that Goody Garlick was
a naughtie woman.&quot;</p>

<p>Goody Edwards testified: &quot;Y't as Goody Garlick owned, <a name="pg121"></a>she sent to her
daughter for a little best milk and she had some and presently after,
her daughters milk went away as she thought and as she remembers the
child sickened about y't time.&quot; Goody Hand deposed that &quot;she had heard
Goody Davis say that she hoped Goody Garlick would not come to
Eastharapton, because, she said, Goody Garlick was naughty, and there
had many sad things befallen y'm at the Island, as about ye child, and
ye ox, as Goody Birdsall have declared, as also the negro child she said
was taken away, as I understood by her words, in a strange manner, and
also of a ram y't was dead, and this fell out quickly one after another,
and also of a sow y't was fat and lustie and died. She said they did
burn some of the sow's tale and presently Goody Garlick did come in.&quot;></p>

<p>The settlers held a town meeting, and wisely questioning whether they
had legal authority to hold a trial in a capital case, they appointed a
committee to go &quot;unto Keniticut to carry up Goodwife Garlick yt she may
be delivered up unto the authoritie there for the trial of the cause of
witchcraft which she is suspected for.&quot; The General Court of Connecticut
took jurisdiction of the case, a trial of Goody Garlick was held,
resulting in her acquittal, and she was sent back to Easthampton, to
what end is not told in the records of the day.</p>

<p>&quot;GOODWIFE KNAP&quot;</p>

<p>This was one of the most notable of the witchcraft cases. It stands
among the early instances of the infliction of the death penalty in
Connecticut; the victim was presumably a woman of good repute, and not a
common scold, an outcast, or a harridan; it is singularly illustrative
of witchcraft's activities and their grasp on the lives of the best men
and women, of the beliefs that ruled the community, and of the crude and
revolting practices resorted to in the punishments of the condemned, and
especially since in its later developments it involved in controversy
and litigation two of the great characters in colonial history, Rev.
John Davenport, one of the founders <a name="pg123"></a>of New Haven, and Roger Ludlow,
Deputy Governor of Massachusetts and Connecticut.<a name="fnanchorI9"></a><a href="#footnoteI9">[I]</a> Goodwife Knapp of
Fairfield was &quot;suspicioned.&quot; That was enough to set the villagers agog
with talk and gossip and scandal about the unfortunate woman, which
poisoned the wells of sober thought and charitable purpose, and swiftly
ripened into a formal accusation and indictment.</p>

<p><a name="footnoteI9"></a><a href="#fnanchorI9">[I]</a> Connecticut, through its Commission of Sculpture, in
recognition of his services to the Colony, is to erect a memorial statue
to Ludlow to occupy the western niche on the northern facade of the
Capitol building at Hartford.</p>
<br />

<p>Pending her trial the prisoner was committed to the house of correction
or common jail for the safe keeping of &quot;refractory persons&quot; and
criminals.</p>

<p>What terrors of mind and spirit must have waited on this &quot;simple minded&quot;
woman, in the cold, gloomy, and comfortless prison, probably built of
rough logs, with a single barred window and massive iron studded door, a
ghost haunted torture chamber, in charge of some harsh wardsmen.</p>

<p>Knapp was duly and truly tried, and sentenced to death by hanging, the
usual mode of execution. <i>No witch was ever burned in New England.</i></p>

<p>From the day sentence was pronounced until the hanging took place, out
in Try's field beyond the Indian field, in view of the villagers, whose
curiosity or thirst for horrors or whose duty led them there, this
prisoner of delusion was made the object of rudest treatment, espionage,
and of inhuman attempts to wring from her lips a confession of her own
guilt or an accusation against some other person as a witch.</p>
<a name="pg124"></a>
<p>The very day of her condemnation, a self-constituted committee of
women, with one man on it,&mdash;Mistress Thomas Sherwood, Goodwife Odell,
Mistress Pell, and her two daughters, Goody Lockwood, and Goodwife
Purdy,&mdash;visited the prison, and pressed her to name any other witch in
town, and so receive such consolation from the minister as would be for
her soul's welfare.</p>

<p>Mistress Pell seems to have been the chief spokeswoman, and each member
of the committee served in some degree as an inquisitor, or exhorter,
not to repentance, but to disclosures. Baited and badgered, warned and
threatened, the hapless prisoner protested she was innocent, denied the
charges made against her, told one of the committee to &quot;take heed the
devile have not you,&quot; and also said, &quot;I must not render evil for
evil.... I have sins enough allready, and I will not add this [accusing
another] to my condemnation.&quot; And at last in agony of soul she made that
pathetic appeal to one of her relentless tormentors, &quot;neuer, neuer poore
creature was tempted as I am tempted, pray, pray for me.&quot;</p>

<p>But even after death on the scaffold, the witch-hunters of the day did
not refrain from their ghoulish work, but desecrated the remains of
Goodwife Knapp at the grave side in their search for witch marks.</p>

<p>All the facts during the imprisonment, execution and burial are set
forth in some of the testimonies herewith given, in a chapter of related
history (the evidence at the trial not being disclosed in any present
record), and all of them marked by a total unconsciousness of their
sinister and revolting character.</p>

<p>No case in the history of the delusion in New England <a name="pg125"></a>is more replete
in incidents and apt illustrations, due to their fortunate preservation
in the records of a lawsuit involving some of the prominent characters
in that drama of religious insanity.</p>

<p>a suit was heard entitled&mdash;</p>

<p>Thomas Staplies of Fairfield, plant'.</p>

<p>Mr Rogger Ludlow late of Fairfield, defendt.</p>

<p>It was brought by an aggrieved husband to recover damages for defamation
of the character of his wife. It centered in one of the dramatic
incidents at Knapp's execution. In the last extremity, and in the
presence of immediate death, the prisoner came down from the ladder, and
asking to speak with Ludlow alone, told him that Goodwife Staplies was a
witch.</p>

<p>Some time afterward Ludlow, at New Haven, told the Rev. John Davenport
and his wife the story, in confidence, and under the promise of secrecy,
but it spread abroad with inevitable accretions, and when it reached
Fairfield Thomas Staplies went to law, to vindicate his wife's character
in pounds, shillings, and pence. These are some of the statements and
remarkable testimonies:</p>

<p><i>Attorney Banke's declaration&mdash;Ensigne Bryan's answer&mdash;Davenport's view
of an oath, Hebrews vi,16&mdash;His account <a name="pg126"></a>and conscientious scruples&mdash;Mistress
Davenport's forgetfulness&mdash;&quot;A tract of lying&quot;&mdash;&quot;Indian gods&quot;&mdash;Luce Pell

<p>&quot;John Bankes, atturny for Thomas Staplies, declared, that Mr. Ludlow had
defamed Thomas Staplies wife, in reporting to Mr. Dauenport and Mris.
Dauenport that she had laid herselfe vnder a new suspition of being a
witch, that she had caused Knapps wife to be new searched after she was
hanged, and when she saw the teates, said if they were the markes of a
witch, then she was one, or she had such markes; secondly, Mr. Ludlow
said Knapps wife told him that goodwife Staplies was a witch; thirdly,
that Mr. Ludlow hath slandered goodwife Staplies in saying that she made
a trade of lying, or went on in a tract of lying, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&quot;Ensigne Bryan, atturny for Mr. Ludlow, desired the charge might bee
proued, wch accordingly the plant' did, and first an attestation vnder
Master Dauenports hand, conteyning the testimony of Master and Mistris
Dauenport, was presented and read; but the defendant desired what was
testified and accepted for proofe might be vpon oath, vpon wch Mr.
Dauenport gaue in as followeth, That he hoped the former attestation hee
wrott and sent to the court, being compared wth Mr. Ludlowes letter, and
Mr. Dauenports answer, would haue satisfyed concerning the truth of the
pticulars wthout his oath, but seeing <a name="pg127"></a>Mr. Ludlowes atturny will not be
so satisfyed, and therefore the court requires his oath, and yt he
lookes at an oath, in a case of necessitie, for confirmation of truth,
to end strife among men, as an ordinance of God, according to Heb: 6,16,
hee therevpon declares as followeth,</p>

<p>&quot;That Mr. Ludlow, sitting wth him &amp; his wife alone, and discoursing of
the passages concerning Knapps wife the witch, and her execution, said
that she came downe from the ladder, (as he vnderstood it,) and desired
to speake wth him alone, and told him who was the witch spoken of; and
so fair as he remembers, he or his wife asked him who it was; he said
she named goodwife Stapleies; Mr. Dauenport replyed that hee beleeued it
was vtterly vntrue and spoken out of malice, or to that purpose; Mr.
Ludlow answered that he hoped better of her, but said she was a foolish
woman, and then told them a further storey, how she tumbled the corpes
of the witch vp &amp; downe after her death, before sundrie women, and spake
to this effect, if these be the markes of a witch I am one, or I haue
such markes. Mr. Dauenport vtterly disliked the speech, not haueing
heard anything from others in that pticular, either for her or against
her, and supposing Mr. Ludlow spake it vpon such intelligenc as
satisfyed him; and whereas Mr. Ludlow saith he required and they
promised secrecy, he doth not remember that either he required or they
pmised it, and he doth rather beleeue the contrary, both because he told
them that some did ouerheare what the witch said to him, and either had
or would spread it abroad, and because he is carefull not to make
vnlawfull promises, and when he <a name="pg128"></a>hath made a lawfull promise he is,
through the help of Christ, carefull to keepe it.</p>

<p>&quot;Mris. Dauenport saith, that Mr. Ludlow being at their house, and
speakeing aboute the execution of Knapps wife, (he being free in his
speech,) was telling seuerall passages of her, and to the best of her
remembrance said that Knapps wife came downe from the ladder to speake
wth him, and told him that goodwife Staplyes was a witch, and that Mr.
Daueport replyed something on behalfe of goodwife Staplies, but the
words she remembers not; and something Mr. Ludlow spake, as some did or
might ouer-heare what she said to him, or words to that effect, and that
she tumbled the dead body of Knapps wife vp &amp; downe and spake words to
this purpose, that if these be the markes of a witch she was one, or had
such markes; and concerning any promise of secrecy she remembers not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Dauenport and Mris. Dauenport affirmed ypon oath, that the
testimonies before written, as they properly belong to each, is the
truth, according to their best knowledg &amp; memory.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Dauenport desired that in takeing his oath to be thus vnderstood,
that as he takes his oath to giue satisfaction to the court and Mr.
Ludlowes atturny, in the matters attested betwixt M' Ludlow &amp; Thomas
Staplies, so he lymits his oath onely to that pt and not to ye preface
or conclusion, they being no pt of the attestation and so his oath not
required in them.</p>

<p>&quot;To the latter pt of the declaration, the plant' pduced ye proofe
following,</p>

<p>&quot;Goodwif Sherwood of Fairfeild affirmeth vpon oath, that vpon some
debate betwixt Mr. Ludlow and goodwife Staplies, she heard M' Ludlow
charge goodwif <a name="pg129"></a>Staplies wth a tract of lying, and that in discourse she
had heard him so charge her seuerall times.</p>

<p>&quot;John Tompson of Fairfeild testifyeth vpon oath, that in discourse he
hath heard Mr. Ludlow express himselfe more then once that goodwife
Staplies went on in a tract of lying, and when goodwife Staplyes hath
desired Mr. Ludlow to convince her of telling one lye, he said she need
not say so, for she went on in a tract of lying.</p>

<p>&quot;Goodwife Gould of Fairefeild testifyeth vpon oath, that in a debate in
ye church wth Mr. Ludlow, goodwife Staplyes desired him to show her
wherein she had told one lye, but Mr. Ludlow said she need not mention
ptculars, for she had gon on in a tract of lying.</p>

<p>&quot;Ensigne Bryan was told, he sees how the plantife hath proued his
charge, to wch he might now answer; wherevpon he presented seuerall
testimonies in wrighting vpon oath, taken before Mr. Wells and Mr.
Ludlow.</p>

<p>&quot;May the thirteenth, 1654.</p>

<p>&quot;Hester Ward, wife of Andrew Ward, being sworne deposeth, that aboute a
day after that goodwife Knapp was condemned for a witch, she goeing to
ye prison house where the said Knapp was kept, she, ye said Knapp,
voluntarily, wthout any occasion giuen her, said that goodwife Staplyes
told her, the said Knapp, that an Indian brought vnto her, the said
Staplyes, two litle things brighter then the light of the day, and told
the said goodwife Staplyes they were Indian gods, as the Indian called
ym; and the Indian wthall told her, the said Staplyes, if she would
keepe them, she would be so big rich, all one god, and that the said
Staplyes told the said Knapp, she <a name="pg130"></a>gaue them again to the said Indian,
but she could not tell whether she did so or no.</p>

<p>&quot;Luce Pell, the wife of Thomas Pell, being sworne deposeth as followeth,
that aboute a day after goodwife Knapp was condemned for a witch, Mris.
Jones earnestly intreated her to goe to ye said Knapp, who had sent for
her, and then this deponent called the said Hester Ward, and they went
together; then the said Knapp voluntarily, of her owne accord, spake as
the said Hester Ward hath testifyed, word by word; and the said Mris.
Pell further saith, that she being one of ye women that was required by
the court to search the said Knapp before she was condemned, &amp; then
Mris. Jones presed her, the said Knapp, to confess whether ther were any
other that were witches, because goodwife goodwife Basset, when she was
condemned, said there was another witch in Fairefeild that held her head
full high, and then the said goodwife Knapp stepped a litle aside, and
told her, this deponent, goodwife Basset ment not her; she asked her
whom she ment, and she named goodwife Staplyes, and then vttered the
same speeches as formerly conerning ye Indian gods, and that goodwife
Staplyes her sister Martha told the said goodwife Knapp, that her sister
Staplyes stood by her, by the fire in there house, and she called to
her, sister, sister, and she would not answer, but she, the said Martha,
strucke at her and then she went away, and ye next day she asked her
sister, and she said she was not there; and Mris. Ward doth also testify
wth Mris. Pell, that the said Knapp said the same to her; and the said
Mris. Pell saith, that aboute two dayes after the search afforesaid, she
went to ye said Knapp in prison house, and the said Knapp <a name="pg131"></a>said to her,
I told you a thing the other day, and goodman Staplies had bine wth her
and threatened her, that she had told some thing of his wife that would
bring his wiues name in question, and this deponent she told no body of
it but her husband, &amp; she was much moued at it.</p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth Brewster being sworne, deposeth and saith, that after
goodwife Knap was executed, as soone as she was cut downe, she, the said
Knapp, being caried to the graue side, goodwife Staplyes wth some other
women went to search the said Knapp, concerning findeing out teats, and
goodwife Staplyes handled her verey much, and called to goodwife
Lockwood, and said, these were no witches teates, but such as she
herselfe had, and other women might haue the same, wringing her hands
and takeing ye Lords name in her mouth, and said, will you say these
were witches teates, they were not, and called vpon goodwife Lockwood to
come &amp; see them; then this deponent desired goodwife Odell to come &amp;
see, for she had bine vpon her oath when she found the teates, and she,
this depont, desired the said Odill to come and clere it to goodwife
Staplies; goodwife Odill would not come; then the said Staplies still
called vpon goodwife Lockwood to come, will you say these are witches
teates, I, sayes the said Staplies, haue such myselfe, and so haue you
if you search yorselfe; goodwife Lockwood replyed, if I had such, she
would be hanged; would you, sayes Staplies, yes, saith Lockwood, and
deserve it; and the said Staplies handeled the said teates very much,
and pulled them wth her fingers, and then goodwife Odill came neere, and
she, the said Staplies, still questioning, the said Odill told her no
honest woman had such, and then all the women rebuking <a name="pg132"></a>her and said
they were witches teates, and the said Staplies yeilded it.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary Brewster being sworn &amp; deposed, saith as followeth, that she was
present after the execution of ye said Knapp, and she being brought to
the graue side, she saw goodwife Staplyes pull the teates that were
found aboute goodwife Knapp, and was verey earnest to know whether those
were witches teates wch were found aboute her, the said Knapp, wn the
women searched her, and the said Staplyes pulled them as though she
would haue pulled them of, and prsently she, ths depont, went away, as
hauing no desire to looke vpon them.</p>

<p>&quot;Susan Lockwood, wife of Robert Lockwood, being sworne &amp; examined saith
as foll, that she was at the execution of goodwife Knapp that was hanged
for a witch, and after the said Knapp was cut downe and brought to the
graue, goodwife Staplyes, wth other women, looked after the teates that
the women spake of appointed by the magistrats, and the said goodwife
Staplies was handling of her where the teates were, and the said
Staplies stood vp and called three or foure times and bid me come looke
of them, &amp; asked her whether she would say they were teates, and she
made this answer, no matter whether there were teates or no, she had
teates and confessed she was a witch, that was sufficient; if these be
teates, here are no more teates then I myselfe haue, or any other women,
or you either if you would search yor body; this depont saith she said,
I know not what you haue, but for herselfe, if any finde any such things
aboute me, I deserved to be hanged as she was, and yet afterward she,
the said Staplyes, stooped downe againe and handled her, <a name="pg133"></a>ye said Knapp,
verey much, about ye place where the teates were, and seuerall of ye
women cryed her downe, and said they were teates, and then she, the said
Staplyes, yeilded, &amp; said verey like they might be teates.</p>

<p>&quot;Thomas Sheruington &amp; Christopher Combstocke &amp; goodwife Baldwine were
all together at the prison house where goodwife Knapp was, and ye said
goodwife Baldwin asked her whether she, the said Knapp, knew of any
other, and she said there were some, or one, that had receiued Indian
gods that were very bright; the said Baldwin asked her how she could
tell, if she were not a witch herselfe, and she said the party told her
so, and her husband was witnes to it; and to this they were all sworne &amp;
doe depose.</p>
<br />

<p>&quot;Rebecka Hull, wife of Cornelius Hull, being sworne &amp; examined, deposeth
&amp; saith as followeth, that when goodwife Knapp was goeing to execution,
Mr. Ludlow, and her father Mr. Jones, pressing the said Knapp to confess
that she was a witch, vpon wch goodwife Staplies said, why should she,
the said Knapp, confess that wch she was not, and after she, the said
goodwife Staplyes, had said so, on that stood by, why should she say so,
she the said Staplyes replyed, she made no doubt if she the said Knapp
were one, she would confess it.</p>

<p>&quot;Deborah Lockwood, of the age of 17 or thereaboute, sworne &amp; examined,
saith as followeth, that she being present when goodwife Knapp was
goeing to execution, betweene Tryes &amp; the mill, she heard goodwife
Staplyes say to goodwife Gould, she was pswaded goodwife Knapp was no
witch; goodwife Gould said, sister Staplyes, she is a witch, &amp; hath
confessed had had familiarity wth the <a name="pg134"></a>Deuill. Staplies replyed, I was
wth her yesterday, or last night, and she said no such thing as she
heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Bethia Brundish, of the age of sixteene or thereaboutes, maketh oath,
as they were goeing to execution of goodwife Knapp, who was condemned
for a witch by the court &amp; jury at Fairfeild, there being present
herselfe &amp; Deborah Lockwood and Sarah Cable, she heard goodwife Staplyes
say, that she thought the said goodwife Knapp was no witch, and goodwife
Gould presently reproued her for it.&quot; &quot;Witnes</p>

<p>&quot;Jurat' die &amp; anno prdicto,</p>

<p>&quot;Coram me, Ro Ludlowe.</p>

<p>&quot;The plant' replyed that he had seuerall other witnesses wch he thought
would cleere the matters in question, if the court please to heare them,
wch being granted, he first presented a testimony of goodwife Whitlocke
of Fairfeild, vpon oath taken before Mr. Fowler at Millford, the 27th of
May, 1654, wherein she saith, that concerning goodwife Staplyes speeches
at the execution of goodwife Knapp, she being present &amp; next to goody
Staplyes when they were goeing to put the dead corpes of goodwife Knapp
into the graue, seuerall women were looking for the markes of a witch
vpon the dead body, and seuerall of the women said they could finde
none, &amp; this depont said, nor I; and she heard goodwife Staplyes say,
nor I; then came one that had searched the said witch, &amp; shewed them the
markes that were vpon her, and said what are these; and then this depont
heard goodwife Staplyes say she never saw such in all her life, and that
she was pswaded that no <a name="pg135"></a>honest woman had such things as those were; and
the dead corps being then prsently put into the graue, goodwife Staplyes
&amp; myselfe came imediately away together vnto the towne, from the place
of execution.</p>

<p>&quot;Goodwife Barlow of Fairfeild before the court did now testify vpon
oath, that when Knapps wife was hanged and ready to be buried, she
desired to see the markes of a witch and spake to one of her neighbours
to goe wth her, and they looked but found them not; then goodwife
Staplyes came to them, and one or two more, goodwife Stapyleyes kneeled
downe by them, and they all looked but found ym not, &amp; said they saw
nothing but what is comon to other women, but after they found them they
all wondered, and goodwife Staplyes in pticular, and said they neuer saw
such things in their life before, so they went away.</p>

<p>&quot;The wife of John Tompson of Fairefeild testifyeth vpon oath, that
goodwife Whitlock, goodwife Staplyes and herselfe, were at the graue and
desired to see ye markes of the witch that was hanged, they looked but
found them not at first, then the midwife came &amp; shewed them, goodwife
Staplyes said she neuer saw such, and she beleeved no honest woman had
such.</p>

<p>&quot;Goodwife Sherwood of Fairefeild testifyeth vpon oath, that that day
Knapps wife was condemned for a witch, she was there to see her, all
being gone forth but goodwife Odill and her selfe, then their came in
Mris. Pell and her two daughters, Elizabeth &amp; Mary, goody Lockwood and
goodwife Purdy; Mris. Pell told Knapps wife she was sent to speake to
her, to haue her confess that for wch she was condemned, and if she knew
any other to be a witch <a name="pg136"></a>to discover them, and told her, before she was
condemned she might thinke it would be a meanes to take away her life,
but now she must dye, and therefore she should discouer all, for though
she and her family by the providence of God had brought in nothing
against her, yet ther was many witnesses came in against her, and she
was cast by the jury &amp; godly magistrats hauing found her guilty, and
that the last evidence cast the cause. So the next day she went in
againe to see the witch wth other neighbours, there was Mr. Jones, Mris.
Pell &amp; her two daughters, Mris. Ward and goodwife Lockwood, where she
heard Mris. Pell desire Knapps wife to lay open herselfe, and make way
for the minister to doe her good; her daughter Elizabeth bid her doe as
the witch at the other towne did, that is, discouer all she knew to be
witches. Goodwife Knapp said she must not say anything wch is not true,
she must not wrong any body, and what had bine said to her in private,
before she went out of the world, when she was vpon the ladder, she
would reveale to Mr. Ludlow or ye minister. Elizabeth Bruster said, if
you keepe it a litle longer till you come to the ladder, the diuill will
haue you quick, if you reveale it not till then. Good: Knapp replyed,
take heed the devile haue not you, for she could not tell how soone she
might be her companyon, and added, the truth is you would haue me say
that goodwife Staplyes is a witch, but I haue sinns enough to answer for
allready, and I hope I shall not add to my condemnation; I know nothing
by goodwife Staplyes, and I hope she is an honest woman. Then goodwife
Lockwood said, goodwife Knapp what ayle you; goodman Lyon, I pray
speake, did you heare vs name goodwif Staplyes name since we came here;
<a name="pg137"></a>Lyon wished her to haue a care what she said and not breed difference
betwixt neighbours after she was gone; Knapp replyed, goodman Lyon hold
yor tongue, you know not what I know, I haue ground for what I say, I
haue bine fished wthall in private more then you are aware of; I
apprehend goodwife Staples hath done me some wrong in her testimony, but
I must not render euill for euill. Then this depont spake to goody
Knapp, wishing her to speake wth the jury, for she apprehended goodwife
Staplyes witnessed nothing contrary to other witnesses, and she supposed
they would informe her that the last evidence did not cast ye cause; she
replyed that she had bine told so wthin this halfe houre, &amp; desired Mr.
Jones and herselfe to stay and the rest to depart, that she might speake
wth vs in private, and desired me to declare to Mr. Jones what they said
against goodwife Staplyes the day before, but she told her she heard not
goodwife Staplyes named, but she knew nothing of that nature; she
desired her to declare her minde fully to M' Jones, so she went away.</p>

<p>&quot;Further this depont saith, that comeing into the house where the witch
was kept, she found onely the wardsman and goodwife Baldwine, there
goodwife Baldwin whispered her in the eare and said to her that goodwife
Knapp told her that a woman in ye towne was a witch and would be hanged
wthin a twelue moneth, and would confess herselfe a witch and cleere her
that she was none, and that she asked her how she knew she was a witch,
and she told her she had reeived Indian gods of an Indian, wch are
shining things, wch shine lighter then the day. Then this depont asked
goodwife Knapp if she had said so, and <a name="pg138"></a>she denyed it; goodwife Baldwin
affirmed she did, but Knapps wife againe denyed it and said she knowes
no woman in the towne that is a witch, nor any woman that hath received
Indian gods, but she said there was an Indian at a womans house and
offerred her a coople of shining things, but she woman neuer told her
she tooke them, but was afraide and ran away, and she knowes not that
the woman euer tooke them. Goodwife desired this depont to goe out and
speake wth the wardsmen; Thomas Shervington, who was one of them, said
hee remembred not that Knapps wife said a woman in the towne was a witch
and would be hanged, but spake something of shining things, but Kester,
Mr. Pells man, being by said, but I remember; and as they were goeing to
the graue, goodwife Staplyes said, it was long before she could beleeve
this poore woman was a witch, or that their were any witches, till the
word of God convinced her, wch saith, thou shalt not suffer a witch to
liue.</p>

<p>&quot;Thomas Lyon of Fairfeild testifyeth vpon oath, taken before Mr. Fowler,
the 27th May, 1654, that he being set by authority to watch wth Knapps
wife, there came in Mris. Pell, Mrs. Ward, goodwife Lockwood, and Mris.
Pells two daughters; the fell into some discourse, that goodwife Knapp
should say to them in private wch goodwife Knapp would not owne, but did
seeme to be much troubled at them and said, the truth is you would haue
me to say that goodwife Staplyes is a witch; I haue sinnes enough
allready, I will not add this to my condemnation, I know no such thing
by her, I hope she is an honest woman; then goodwife Lockwood caled to
mee and asked whether they had named goodwife Staplyes, so I spake to
goodwife <a name="pg139"></a>Knapp to haue a care what she said, that she did not make
differrence amongst her neighbours when she was gon, and I told her that
I hoped they were her frends and desired her soules good, and not to
accuse any out of envy, or to that effect; Knapps wife said, goodman
Lyon hold yor tongue, you know not so much as I doe, you know not what
hath bine said to me in private; and after they was gon, of her owne
accord, betweene she &amp; I, goody Knapp said she knew nothing against
goodwife Staplyes of being a witch.</p>

<p>&quot;Goodwife Gould of Fairfeild testifyeth vpon oath, that goodwife
Sherwood &amp; herselfe came in to see the witch, there was one before had
bine speaking aboute some suspicious words of one in the towne, this
depont wished her if she knew anything vpon good ground she would
declare it, if not, that she would take heede that the deuill pswaded
her not to sow malicious seed to doe hurt when she was dead, yet wished
her to speake the truth if she knew anything by any pson; she said she
knew nothing but vpon suspicion by the rumours she heares; this depont
told her she was now to dye, and therefore she should deale truly; she
burst forth ito weeping and desired me to pray for her, and said I knew
not how she was tempted; neuer, neuer poore creature was tempted as I am
tempted, pray, pray for me. Further this depont saith, as they were
goeing to ye graue, Mr. Buckly, goodwife Sherwood, goodwife Staplye and
myselfe, goodwife Staplyes was next me, she said it was a good while
before she could beleeue this woman was a witch, and that she could not
beleue a good while that there were any witches, till she went to ye
word of God, and then she was convinced, and as she remembers, goodwife
Stapleyes went along wth her all the way <a name="pg140"></a>till they came at ye gallowes.
Further this deponent saith, that Mr. Jones some time since that Knapps
wife was condemned, did tell her, and that wth a very cherefull
countenance &amp; blessing God for it, that Knapps wife had cleered one in
ye towne, &amp; said you know who I meane sister Staplyes, blessed be God
for it.&quot;</p>

<p>Staplies' wife was a character. She was &quot;a light woman&quot; from the night
of her memorable ride with Tom Tash, to Jemeaco, Long Island, to the
suspicion of herself as a witch, and the &quot;repairing&quot; of her name by
Thomas' lawsuit, and her own indictment for familiarity with Satan some
years later. That she had many of the traditional witch qualities, and
was something of a gymnast and hypnotist, is written in the vivid
recollections of Tash's experience with her. This was his account of it
on oath thirty years after:</p>

<p>&quot;John Tash aged about sixty four or thareabouts saith he being at Master
Laueridges at Newtown on Long Island aboutt thirty year since Goodman
Owen and Goody Owin desired me to goe with Thomas Stapels wiffe of
Fairfield to Jemeaco on Long Island to the hous of George Woolsy and as
we war going along we cam to a durty slow and thar the hors blundred in
the slow and I mistrusted that she the said Goody Stapels was off the
hors and I was troubiled in my mind very much soe as I cam back I
thought I would tak better noatis how it was and when I cam to the slow
abovesaid I put on the hors prity sharp and then I put my hand behind me
and felt for her and she was not upon the hors and as soon as we war out
of the slow she was on the hors behind me boath going and coming and
when I cam home I told thes words to Master <a name="pg141"></a>Leveredg that she was a
light woman as I judged and I am redy to give oath to this when leagaly
caled tharunto as witnes my hand.</p>

<p>his &quot;John+Tash mark</p>

<p>&quot;Grenwich July 12, 1692.</p>

<p>&quot;John Tash hath given oath to his testimony abovesaid</p>

<p>&quot;Before me John Renels Comessener.&quot;</p>
<br />

<p>And Mistress Staplies had other qualities, always potent in small
communities to invite criticism and dislike. She was a shrewd and
shrewish woman, impatient of some of the Puritan social standards and of
the laws of everyday life. She openly condemned certain common
moralities, was reckless in criticism of her neighbors, and quarreled
with Ludlow about some church matters.</p>

<p>It is evident from the testimonies that Staplies was on both sides as to
the guilt of goodwife Knapp, and when rumor and suspicion began to point
to herself as a mischief-maker and busybody in witchcraft matters, to
divert attention from his wife and set a backfire to the sweep of public
opinion, Thomas sued Ludlow, and despite his strong and clear defense as
shown on the record evidence, the court in his absence awarded damages
against him for defamation and for charging Staplies' wife with going on
&quot;in a tract of lying,&quot; &quot;in reparation of his wife's name&quot; as the
judgment reads. Mistress Staplies did not grow in grace, or in the
graces of her neighbors, since some years later she was indicted for
witchcraft, tried, and acquitted with others, at Fairfield, in 1692.<a name="fnanchorJ10"></a><a href="#footnoteJ10">[J]</a></p>

<a name="chap11"></a><h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>&quot;The planters of New England were Englishmen, not exempt from
English prejudices in favor of English institutions, laws and usages ...
They had not been taught to question the wisdom or the humanity of
English criminal law. They were as unconscious of its barbarism, as
were the parliaments which had enacted or the courts which dispensed
it.&quot; <i>Blue Laws, True and False</i> (p. 15), J. HAMMOND TRUMBULL.</p>

&quot;It would seem a marvellous panic, this that shook the rugged reasoners in its iron grasp, and led to such insanity as this displayed toward Alse Young, did we not know that it was but the result of a normal inhuman law confirmed by a belief in the divine, the direct legacy of England, the unquestionable utterance of Church and State.&quot; <i>One Blank of Windsor</i>, ANNIE ELIOT TRUMBULL.<br />

<p>This brief review of witchcraft in some of its historical aspects, of
its spread to the New England colonies, of its rise and suppression in
the Connecticut towns, with the citations from the original records
which admit no challenge of the facts, may be aptly closed by what is
believed to be a complete list of the Connecticut witchcraft cases,
authenticated by conclusive evidence of time, place, incident, and
circumstance.</p>

<p>Some minor questions may be put, or kept in controversy, as one writer
or another, who regards history as a matter of opinion, not of fact, and
relying on tradition or hearsay evidence or on superficial
investigation, gives a place to guesswork instead of truth, to
historical conceits instead of historical verities.</p>

<p><a name="pg143"></a>A RECORD OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAME UNDER SUSPICION OR ACCUSATION OF
WITCHCRAFT IN CONNECTICUT, AND WHAT BEFELL THEM.</p>

<p>Herein are written the names of all persons in anywise involved in the
witchcraft delusion in Connecticut, with the consequences to them in
indictments, trials, convictions, executions, or in banishment, exile,
warnings, reprieves, or acquittals, so far as made known in any
tradition, document, public or private record, to this time.</p>

<p>MARY JOHNSON. Windsor, 1647.</p>

<p>There is no documentary or other evidence to show that Mary Johnson was
executed for witchcraft in Windsor in 1647. The charge rests on an entry
in Governor Winthrop's <i>Journal</i>, &quot;One ---- of Windsor arraigned and
executed at Hartford for a witch.&quot; WINTHROP'S <i>History of New England</i>
(Savage, 2: 374).</p>

<p>No importance would have attached to this statement, which bears no date
and does not give the name or sex of the condemned, had not Dr. Savage
in his annotations of the <i>Journal</i> (2: 374) asserted that it was &quot;the
first instance of the delusion in New England,&quot; and without warrant
added, &quot;Perhaps there was sense enough early in the colony to destroy
the record.&quot;</p>

<p>In all discussions of this matter, it has been assumed or conceded (in
the absence of any positive proof), by such eminent critics and scholars
as Drake, Fiske, Poole, Hoadley, Stiles, and others, that Winthrop's
note was based on rumor or hearsay, or that it related to the later
conviction and execution of a woman of the same name, next noted, <a name="pg144"></a>and
the errors as to person, time, and place might easily have been made.</p>

<p>MARY JOHNSON. Wethersfield, 1648.</p>

<p>This Mary Johnson left a definite record. It is written in broad lines
in the dry-as-dust chronicles of the time. Cotton Mather embalmed the
tragedy in his <i>Magnalia</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;There was one Mary Johnson tryd at Hartford in this countrey, upon an
indictment of 'familiarity with the devil,' and was found guilty
thereof, chiefly upon her own confession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And she dyd in a frame extreamly to the satisfaction of them that were
spectators of it.&quot; <i>Magnalia Christi Americana</i> (6: 7).</p>

<p>At a session of the Particular Court held in Hartford, August 21, 1646,
Mary Johnson for thievery was sentenced to be presently whipped, and to
be brought forth a month hence at Wethersfield, and there whipped. The
whipping post, even in those days, did not prove a means to repentance
and reformation, since at a session of the same court, December 7, 1648,
the jury found a bill of indictment against Mary Johnson, that by her
own confession she was guilty of familiarity with the devil.</p>

<p>That she was condemned and executed seems certain (it being assumed that
Mary and Elizabeth Johnson were one and the same person, both Christian
names appearing in the record), since at a session of the General Court,
May 21, 1650, the prison-keeper's charges for her imprisonment were
allowed and ordered paid &quot;out of her estate.&quot;</p>

<p>A pathetic incident attaches to this case. A child to this poor woman
was &quot;borne in the prison,&quot; who was <a name="pg145"></a>bound out until he became twenty-one
years of age, to Nathaniel Rescew, to whom &pound;15 were paid according to
the mother's promise to him, he having engaged himself &quot;to meinteine and
well educate her sonne.&quot; <i>Colonial Records of Connecticut</i>

<p>THE FIRST EXECUTION FOR WITCHCRAFT IN NEW ENGLAND</p>

<p><i>A secret long kept made known&mdash;Winthrop's journal entry probably
correct&mdash;Tradition and surmise make place for historical certainty&mdash;The
evidence of an eyewitness&mdash;A notable service.</i></p>

<p>ALSE YOUNG. Windsor, 1647.</p>

<p>&quot;May 26. 47 Alse Young was hanged.&quot; MATTHEW GRANT'S <i>Diary</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;The first entry (the executions of Carrington and his wife being next
mentioned) supplies the name of the 'One (blank) of Windsor arraigned
and executed at Hartford for a witch'&mdash;the first known execution for
witchcraft in New England. I have found no mention elsewhere of this
Alse Young.&quot; J. HAMMOND TRUMBULL'S <i>Observation on Grant's Entry</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Who then was the 'witch' with whose execution Connecticut stepped into
the dark shadow of persecution? She has been called Mary Johnson, but no
Mary Johnson has been identified as this earliest victim. Whose is that
pathetic figure shrinking in the twilight of that early record? We could
think of her with no less kindly compassion could we give a name to the
unhappy victim of the misread Word of God, who was led forth to a death
<a name="pg146"></a>stripped of dignity as of consolation: who to an ignorance and
credulity, brought from an old world and not yet sifted out by the
enlightenment and experience of a new, yielded up her perhaps miserable
but unforfeited life. Here is the note which in all probability
establishes the identity of the One of Windsor arraigned and executed as
a witch&mdash;'May 26, 47 Alse Young was hanged.'&quot; <i>&quot;One Blank&quot; of Windsor</i>
(Courant Literary Section, 12, 3, 1904), ANNIE ELIOT TRUMBULL.</p>
<br />

<p>Matthew Grant came over with the Dorchester men from the Bay Colony in
1635, and settled in Windsor, Connecticut, where he lived until his
death there in 1683.</p>

<p>He was a land surveyor, and the town clerk, a close observer of men and
their public and private affairs, and kept a careful record of current
events in a &quot;crabbed, eccentric but by no means entirely illegible hand&quot;
during the long years of his sojourn in the &quot;Lord's Waste.&quot;</p>

<p>It has been surmised for several years&mdash;but without confirmation&mdash;and
credited by the highest authorities in Connecticut colonial history, and
known only to one of them, that Grant's manuscript diary contained the
significant historical note as to the fate of Alse Young. It waited two
centuries and more for its true interpreter, as did Wolcott's cipher
notes of Hooker's famous sermon, and there it is, &quot;not made on the
decorous pages which memorize the saints,&quot; Brookes, Hooker, Warham,
Reyner, Hanford, and Huit, &quot;but scrawled on the inside of the cover,
where it might be the sinner might escape detection.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="pg147"></a>In the publication of Grant's note Miss Trumbull has rendered a great
service in the settlement of a disputed question, in the correction of
errors, in fixing the priority of the outbreak between Massachusetts and
Connecticut; and in the new light shining through this revelation stands
Alse, glorified with the qualities of youth, of gentleness, of
innocence; and the story of her going to the unholy sacrifice on that
fateful May morning more than two and a half centuries ago is told with
exquisite tenderness and pathos.</p>

<p>Confirmation of the truth of Grant's entry is given by the scholarly
historian of Windsor, Dr. Stiles, who says in his history of that
ancient town:</p>

<p>&quot;We know that a John Youngs, [?] bought land in Windsor of William
Hubbard in 1641&mdash;which he sold in 1649&mdash;and thereafter disappears from
record. He may have been the husband or father of 'Achsah'[?] the witch;
if so, it would be most natural that he and his family should leave
Windsor.&quot; STILES' <i>History of Windsor</i> (pp. 444-450).</p>
<br />

<p>JOHN and JOAN CARRINGTON. Wethersfield, 1651.</p>

<p>They were indicted at a court held February 20, 1651, Governor John
Haynes and Edward Hopkins being present, with other magistrates; and
they were found guilty on March 6, 1651. Both were executed. <i>Records
Particular Court</i> (2: 17). [Dr. Hoadley's note in this case: &quot;Mr.
Trumbull (Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull) told me he had a record of execution
in these cases. I suppose he referred to the diary of Matthew Grant.&quot;]
The entry of the execution appears in Grant's <i>Diary</i>, after the note as
to Alse Young. <i>One Blank of Windsor</i>, TRUMBULL.</p>

<p>LYDIA GILBERT. Windsor, 1654.</p>

<p>October 3, 1651, Henry Stiles of Windsor was killed by the accidental
discharge of a gun in the hands of Thomas Allyn, also of Windsor. An
inquest was held, and Thomas was indicted in the following December. He
plead guilty, and at the trial the jury found the fact to be &quot;homicide
by misadventure.&quot; Thomas was fined &pound;20 for his &quot;sinful neglect and
careless carriage,&quot; and put under a bond of &pound;10, for good behavior for a
year. <i>Records Particular Court</i> (2: 29-57).</p>

<p>But witchcraft was abroad, and its tools and emissaries more than two
years afterwards fastened suspicion of this death by clear accident, on
Lydia Gilbert, it being charged that &quot;thou hast of late years, or still
dost give entertainment to Sathan ... and by his helpe hast killed the
body of Henry Styles, besides other witchcrafts.&quot;</p>

<p>She was indicted and tried in September or November, 1654, and &quot;Ye party
above mentioned is found guilty of witchcraft by ye jury.&quot; Her fate is
not written in any known record, but the late Honorable S.O. Griswold, a
recognized authority on early colonial history in Windsor, says that as
the result of a close examination of the record, &quot;I think the reasonable
probability is that she was hanged.&quot; <i>Records Particular Court</i> (2: 51);

<p>WILLIAM MEAKER. New Haven, 1657. Accused acquitted.</p>

<p>Thomas Mullener was always in trouble. He was a chronic litigant. His
many contentions are noted at length in the court records. Among other
things he made up his mind that his pigs were bewitched, so &quot;he did cut
of the tayle and eare of one and threw into the fire,&quot; &quot;said it was <a name="pg150"></a>a
meanes used in England by some people to finde out witches,&quot; and in the
light of this porcine sacrifice he charged his neighbor William Meaker
with the bewitching. Meaker promptly brought an action of defamation,
but Mullener became involved in other controversies and &quot;miscarriages,&quot;
to the degree that he was advised to remove out of the place, and put
under bonds for good behavior; and Meaker, probably feeling himself
vindicated, dropped his suit. <i>New Haven Colonial Records</i> (2: 224).</p>

<p>The major part of the jury found Nicholas guilty, but the rest only
strongly suspected him, and as to Margaret, some found her guilty, and
the others suspected her to be guilty. It is probable that the Jennings
were under inquiry when, at a session of the General Court at Hartford,
June 15, 1659, it was recorded that &quot;Mr. Willis is requested to goe
downe to Sea Brook, to assist ye Maior in examininge the suspitions

<p>JUDITH VARLETT (VARLETH). Hartford, 1662. Arrested; released.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Rebecca Greensmith in her confession, among
other things, said that Mrs. Judith Varlett told her that she (Varlett)
&quot;was much troubled wth ye Marshall Jonath: Gilbert &amp; cried, &amp; she sayd
if it lay in her power she would doe him a mischief, or what hurt shee
could.&quot;</p>

<p>Judith must have indulged in other indiscretions of association or of
speech, since she soon fell under suspicion of witchcraft, and was put
under arrest and imprisoned. But she had a powerful friend at court
(who, despite his many contentions and intrigues, commanded the
attention of the Connecticut authorities), in the person of her
brother-in-law Peter Stuyvesant, then bearing the title and office of
&quot;Captain General and Commander-in-Chief <a name="pg152"></a>of Amsterdam In New Netherland,
now called New York, and the Dutch West India Islands.&quot; It was doubtless
due to his intercession in a letter of October 13, 1662, that she was
released.</p>

<p>The letter:</p>

<p>WILLIAM AYRES and GOODY AYRES his Wife. Hartford, 1662. Arrested. Fled
from the colony.</p>

<p>ELIZABETH SEAGER. Hartford, 1662. Convicted; discharged.</p>

<p>Goody Seager probably deserved all that came to her in trials and
punishment. She was one of the typical characters in the early
communities upon whom distrust <a name="pg153"></a>and dislike and suspicion inevitably
fell. Exercising witch powers was one of her more reputable qualities.
She was indicted for blasphemy, adultery, and witchcraft at various
times, was convicted of adultery, and found guilty of witchcraft in
June, 1665. She owed her escape from hanging to a finding of the Court
of Assistants that the jury's verdict did not legally answer to the
indictment, and she was set &quot;free from further suffering or
imprisonment.&quot; <i>Records County Court</i> (3: 5: 52); <i>Colonial Records of

<br />

<p>NICHOLAS DESBOROUGH. Hartford, 1683. Suspicioned.</p>

<p>Desborough was a landowner in Hartford, having received a grant of fifty
acres for his services in the Pequot war. He owes his enrollment in the
hall of fame to Cotton Mather, who was so self-satisfied with his
efforts in &quot;Relating the wonders of the invisible world in preternatural
occurrences&quot; that in his pedantic exuberance he put in a learned
sub-title: &quot;Miranda cano, sed sunt credenda&quot; (The themes I sing are
marvelous, yet true).</p>

<p>Fourteen examples were chosen for the &quot;Thaumatographia <a name="pg154"></a>Pneumatica,&quot; as
&quot;remarkable histories&quot; of molestations from evil spirits, and Mather
said of them, &quot;that no reasonable man in this whole country ever did
question them.&quot;</p>

<p>Desborough stands in place as the &quot;fourth example.&quot; No case more clearly
illustrates the credulity that neutralized common sense in strong men.
It was a case of abstraction, or theft, or mistaken thrift. A &quot;chest of
cloaths&quot; was missing. The owner, instead of going to law, found his
remedy &quot;in things beyond the course of nature,&quot; and he and his friends
with &quot;nimble hands&quot; pelted Desborough's house, and himself when abroad,
with stones, turves, and corncobs, and finally some of his property was
burned by a fire &quot;in an unknown way kindled.&quot; Is it not enough to note
that Mather closes this wondrous tale of the spiritual molestations with
the very human explanation that &quot;upon the restoring of the cloaths, the
trouble ceased&quot;?</p>

<p>WINIFRED BENHAM SENIOR and JUNIOR. Wallingford, 1697. Acquitted.</p>

<p>They were mother and daughter (twelve or thirteen years old), tried at
Hartford and acquitted in August, 1697; indicted on new complaints in
October, 1697, but the jury returned on the bill, &quot;Ignoramus.&quot; <i>Records
Court of Assistants</i> (1: 74, 77).</p>
<br />

<p>SARAH SPENCER. Colchester, 1724. Accused. Damages 1s.</p>

<p>Even a certificate of the minister as to her religion and virtue, could
not free Sarah from a reputation as a witch. And when Elizabeth (and how
many Connecticut witches bore that name) Ackley accused her of &quot;riding
and pinching,&quot; and James Ackley, her husband, made threats, Sarah sued
them for a fortune in those days, &pound;500 damages, and got judgment for &pound;5,
with costs. The Ackleys appealed, and at the trial the jury awarded
Sarah damages of ls., and also stated that they found the Ackleys not
insane&mdash;a clear demonstration that the mental condition of witchcraft
accusers was taken account of in the later and saner times.</p>
<br />

<p>NORTON. Bristol, 1768. Suspicioned. No record.</p>

<p>&quot;On the mountain,&quot; probably Fall mountain in Bristol, the antics of a
young woman named Norton, who accused her aunt of putting a bridle on
her and driving her through the air to witch meetings in Albany, caused
<a name="pg156"></a>a commotion among the virtuous people. Deacon Dutton's ox was torn
apart by an invisible agent, and unseen hands brought new ailments to
the residents there, pinched them and stuck red hot pins into them.
Elder Wildman set out to exorcise the evil spirit, but became so
terrorized that he called for help, and one of his posse of assistants
was scared into convulsions. This case may be counted among the last,
perhaps the last traditions of the strange delusion which aforetime
filled the hills and valleys of Quohnectacut with its baleful light.

<p>What of those men and women to whom justice in their time was meted out,
in this age of reason, of religious enlightenment, liberty, and
catholicity, when witchcraft has lost its mystery and power, when
intelligence reigns, and the Devil works his will in other devious ways
and in a more attractive guise?</p>

<p>They were the victims of delusion, not of dishonor, of a perverted
theology fed by moral aberrations, of a fanaticism which never stopped
to reason, and halted at no sacrifice to do God's service; and they were
all done to <a name="pg158"></a>death, or harried into exile, disgrace, or social
ostracism, through a mistaken sense of religious duty: but they stand
innocent of deep offense and only guilty in the eye of the law written
in the Word of God, as interpreted and enforced by the forefathers who
wrought their condemnation, and whose religion made witchcraft a heinous
sin, and whose law made it a heinous crime.</p>

<p>Is the contrast in human experience, between the servitude to credulity
and superstition in 1647-97 and the deliverance from it of this day, any
wider than between the ironclad theology of that and of later times, and
the challenge to it, and its diabolical logic, of yesterday, which marks
a new era in denominational creeds, in religious beliefs, and their
expression?</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards, in his famous sermon at Enfield in 1741, on &quot;Sinners
in the hands of an Angry God,&quot; was inspired to say to the impenitent:
&quot;The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider
or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you and is dreadfully
provoked; His wrath toward you burns like fire; He looks upon you as
worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire; He is of purer eyes
than to bear to have you in His sight; you are 10,000 times so
abominable in His eyes as the most hateful and venomous serpent is in
ours.... Instead of one how many is it likely will remember this
discourse in hell! And it would be a wonder if some that are now present
should not be in hell in a very short time&mdash;before this year is out. And
it would be no wonder if some persons, that now sit here in some seats
of this meeting-house, in health and quiet, and secure, should be there
before to-morrow morning.&quot; <a name="pg159"></a>One hundred and sixty-three years later,
Rev. Dr. Samuel T. Carter, a godly minister of the same faith, &quot;a
heretic who is no heretic,&quot; stood before the presbytery of Nassau, was
invited to remain in the Presbyterian communion, and yet said this of
the doctrine of Edwards, as written in the <i>Westminster Confession</i>: &quot;In
God's name and Christ's name it is not true. There is no such God as the
God of the confession. There is no such world as the world of the
confession. There is no such eternity as the eternity of the
confession.... This world so full of flowers and sunshine and the
laughter of children is not a cursed lost world, and the 'endless
torment' of the confession is not God's, nor Christ's, nor the Bible's
idea of future punishment.&quot;</p>

<p>What should constitute the true faith of a Christian, and set him apart
from his fellowmen in duties and observances, was one of the crucial
questions in the everyday life of the early New England colonists, and
the hanging and discipline of witches was one of its necessary
incidents.</p>

<p>It was the same spirit of intolerance and of religious animosity that
was written in the treatment of the Quakers and Baptists at Boston; in
the experience of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson; and of &quot;The
Rogerenes&quot; in Connecticut, for &quot;profanation of the Sabbath,&quot; told in a
chapter of forgotten history.</p>

<p>In the sunlight of the later revelation, is not the present judgment of
the men and women of those far off times, &quot;when the wheel of prayer was
in perpetual motion,&quot; when fear and superstition and the wrath of an
angry God ruled the strongest minds, truly interpreted in the solemn
<a name="pg160"></a>afterthoughts which the poet ascribes to the magistrate and minister at
the grave of Giles Corey?</p>

<a name="histhote"></a><h2>HISTORICAL NOTE</h2>

<p>ROGER LUDLOW</p>
<br />

<p>The Connecticut historians to a very recent date, in ignorance of the
facts, and despite his notable services of twenty-four years to the
colonies, left Ludlow to die in obscurity in Virginia or elsewhere, and
some of the traditions, based on no record or other evidence, have been
recently repeated. It is therefore proper to state here in few words who
Ludlow was, what he did both in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and after
his &quot;return into England&quot; in 1654.</p>

<p>Ludlow came of an ancient English family, which gave to history in his
own time and generation such illustrious kinsmen as Sir Henry Ludlow, a
member of the Long Parliament and one of the Puritan leaders, and Sir
Edmund Ludlow, member of Parliament, Lieutenant-General under Cromwell,
member of the court at King Charles' trial, and whom Macaulay named &quot;the
most illustrious saviour of a mighty race of men, the judges of a king,
the founders of a republic.&quot;</p>

<p>In May, 1630, Ludlow came to Massachusetts, as one of the Assistants
under the charter of &quot;The Governor and company of Massachusetts Bay in
New England.&quot;</p>

<p>His services in the Bay Colony from 1630-35 ranged from the duties of a
magistrate in the Great Charter Court to those of the high office of
Deputy Governor. The <a name="pg162"></a>quality of that service is written in a bare
statement of his various offices&mdash;surveyor, negotiator of the Pequot
treaty, colonel ex officio, auditor of Governor Winthrop's accounts,
superintendent of fortifications, military commissioner, member of the
General Court, Deputy Governor when Thomas Dudley was Governor; and he
was always one of the foremost men in civil, political, and social
affairs, to the day of his departure to &quot;the valley of the long
river,&quot;&mdash;a day of good fortune for Connecticut.</p>

<p>When Massachusetts established church membership as the condition of
suffrage,&mdash;and radical differences of opinion on other matters
arose,&mdash;it marked the culmination of a set purpose of some of her ablest
men to remove from her jurisdiction, among whom Hooker, Ludlow, and
Haynes were the most notable. The General Court created a commission to
govern Connecticut for a year, and made Ludlow its chief. He came to the
new land of promise with the Dorchester men, and settled in Windsor in
1635-36.</p>

<p>What he did in the nineteen years of his residence at Windsor and
Fairfield is epitomized in a brief summary of the duties and honors to
which he was called by his fellowmen:</p>

<p>Chief of the Massachusetts commission and the first Governor, de facto;
organizer and chief magistrate of the first court; writer of the
earliest laws; president of the court which declared war against the
Pequots; framer of the Fundamental Orders&mdash;the Constitution of
1639&mdash;which embodied the great principles of government by the people
propounded and elucidated by the illustrious Thomas Hooker, in his
letter to Governor Winthrop, and <a name="pg163"></a>in his famous sermon; compiler, at the
request of the General Court, of the <i>Body of Lawes</i>, the <i>Code of
1650</i>; commissioner on important state matters; commissioner for the
United Colonies; founder and defender of Fairfield; patriot, jurist,
statesman.</p>

<p>Ludlow left Connecticut in 1654, not to die in obscurity as the earlier
writers imagined, but to serve abroad for several years in positions of
honor and distinction.</p>

<p>Cromwell invited him to return, as he did many of the leading Puritans
in New England, and appointed him a commissioner for the administration
of justice in Dublin; also to serve with the chief justice of the upper
bench and other distinguished lawyers, to determine all the claims to
the forfeited Irish lands, and at last as a Master in Chancery.</p>

<p>Ten years Ludlow served in these important stations; and at his death,
probably in 1664, he was buried in St. Michael's churchyard in Dublin,
with his wife&mdash;a sister of Governor John Endicott&mdash;and other members of
his family.<a name="fnanchorK11"></a><a href="#footnoteK11">[K]</a></p>

Produced by Suzanne Shell, Sjaani and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
